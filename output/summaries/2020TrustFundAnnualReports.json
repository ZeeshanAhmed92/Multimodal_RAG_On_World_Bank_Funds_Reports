The Jobs-After-COVID workstream will address medium-term job transition challenges post-pandemic, building on the JobsWatch initiative and new proposals targeting post-COVID jobs solutions.",
    "The Jobs Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) Phase I has supported the World Bank Group's Jobs Agenda by providing studies, data, policy notes, and technical assistance to enhance job creation and quality. The fund aligns with the WBG's broader priorities, including initiatives like the IDA Jobs and Economic Transformation (JET) special theme, the Human Capital Project, and IFC’s market-focused strategy. The JET approach focuses on creating better jobs through macro-financial stability, strong institutions, improved business environments, infrastructure, and inclusive finance. It promotes productivity by reallocating resources to high-potential sectors, expanding market access through trade and urbanization, and upgrading jobs and enterprises via technology and skill development.",
    "The document outlines strategies to enhance productivity and job creation through sector diversification, connectivity, and technology upgrades, supported by stable macroeconomic conditions, governance, and infrastructure. The Human Capital Project (HCP), launched in 2017 by the World Bank, aims to improve education and health outcomes to boost economic growth via the Human Capital Index, targeted measurement and research, and support for country-level investment strategies. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) focuses on job creation through market development, private capital mobilization, and measuring direct and indirect job impacts, using tools like the Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring system to guide project selection and design for inclusive economic growth.",
    "The IFC and ILO's Better Work program improves garment factory working conditions by training advisors to ensure compliance with labor laws and standards through assessments, continuous improvement dialogues, and stakeholder engagement across nine countries. IFC also runs the Gender Equality and Returns (GEAR) program to advance women into supervisory roles through training, and offers GenderSmart Business Solutions to promote gender inclusion, resolve labor issues, and enhance performance, supporting initiatives like SheWorks and Tackling Childcare.",
    "IFC's Gender-smart Business Solutions include the SheWorks Global Partnership, which advances women's employment and leadership through policies, mentorship, anti-harassment measures, and flexible work. The Tackling Childcare initiative highlights the business benefits of family-friendly workplace policies across multiple countries and leads a global working group to support employer childcare solutions. The Jobs MDTF, operational since 2015, consolidates World Bank Group jobs-related activities, funding 115 grants in 44 countries to support job strategies, private sector growth, youth employment, fragile contexts, and research, contributing to multiple job-related outcomes.",
    "The MDTF enhanced job policy design and dialogue by funding studies on job creation responsiveness to growth and trade impacts on employment in South Asia, influencing policy reforms in Bangladesh and promoting labor-intensive production. It produced actionable Jobs Solutions Notes based on diverse evidence. The MDTF also emphasized the private sector's role in job creation, supporting value chain analyses in Zambia and Mozambique to boost small-scale farmer income and inclusive agribusiness jobs, and backed IFC initiatives promoting gender-smart childcare in workplaces.",
    "The MDTF has supported innovative World Bank jobs lending operations focused on job creation, improving informal job quality, and connecting vulnerable groups to employment. Examples include the TWIST program in the Solomon Islands, enhancing women's employability in the tuna industry through skills training and private sector partnerships, and a multi-sector youth jobs project in Tunisia addressing barriers to job access and providing business support linked to job creation. The MDTF also backs policy reforms like Jordan's $500 million development policy financing for equitable growth and job creation. Additionally, the SEJLS program was launched to improve measurement and design of jobs outcomes in large-scale World Bank lending, funding 15 strategic projects with over $5 million.",
    "MDTF grants have enhanced stakeholder capacity in countries like Ecuador and Sierra Leone by improving labor market data systems and supporting labor force surveys. The Jobs Core Course educated over 100 policymakers on jobs strategies. Additionally, MDTF developed tools and methodologies for job analytics, including Standardized Job Diagnostics used in over 30 countries, a Jobs M&E Toolkit for integrating jobs agendas in projects, and the COVID-19 JobsWatch initiative to analyze labor market impacts and guide policy responses during the pandemic.",
    "The MDTF has enhanced the evidence base on job challenges and solutions by improving data collection and access. In Haiti, it used cell-phone data to study urban commuting barriers; in Kenya, it found no negative impact of supporting small businesses on competitors; and in Turkey, it linked management quality to firm productivity and job quality. Additionally, the MDTF has improved knowledge sharing through web platforms, establishing practitioner networks, and launching resources like the Jobs Data Visualization App and JOIN, a global labor market indicator database, to support policymakers and researchers.",
    "The Jobs MDTF's first phase (2015–2020) generated valuable insights on project design and implementation affecting job outcomes. Key lessons include strong WBG support for the SEJLS approach, effective targeting of champion projects through direct engagement with leadership, and the need for more rigorous and standardized measurement of job outcomes, including indirect and induced jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted inefficiencies in job data coordination and underscored the importance of outreach, stakeholder engagement, and capacity building in client countries for job diagnostics and strategies. The crisis also emphasized the critical role of private sector job creation, especially for MSMEs, women, and youth, with IDA countries facing severe challenges. The Jobs MDTF’s cross-sectoral governance through the Jobs Steering Committee facilitated coordination and response efforts during the pandemic.",
    "The Jobs MDTF Phase II (2021-2025) aims to support the design and implementation of comprehensive jobs strategies in WBG client countries and advance knowledge on effective policies for sustainable jobs, especially for vulnerable groups. It responds to COVID-19's impact on labor markets by focusing on large-scale operationalization, innovative research, and increased outreach. Key principles include integration across sectors, addressing COVID-19 impacts, leveraging private sector potential, closing gender gaps, supporting vulnerable populations (youth, minorities, disabled), and aligning with WBG strategic priorities such as the 2019 WDR, FCV strategy, IDA19 JET, Gender Strategy, and global agendas like the Human Capital Project and Universal Social Protection 2030.",
    "The Jobs MDTF, launched in 2015, initially operated through five windows focusing on diagnostics, private sector job creation, youth employment, jobs in fragile contexts, and research. In Phase II, it is restructured into three windows: (1) Jobs Lending at Scale, to improve and scale WBG jobs operations with standardized approaches and rigorous economic analysis; (2) Measurement, to enhance data and diagnostics on jobs outcomes; and (3) Influence through Partnerships and Innovation, to engage stakeholders and promote innovative job solutions. Window 1 emphasizes integrating jobs outcomes into project design, economic analysis of social gains, specifying beneficiary groups, and monitoring through targeted indicators, building on the SEJLS pilot and expanding IFC involvement.",
    "Window 2 focuses on enhancing evidence-based jobs initiatives by upgrading country-level data and diagnostics on jobs outcomes and advancing technical capacity for measuring these outcomes. It aims to provide policymakers with better data, conduct diagnostics to identify key job challenges, and promote reliable measurement of economy-wide job effects. The approach includes standardized country and regional Jobs Diagnostics to analyze jobs issues in context, feeding into broader economic assessments. Additionally, Window 2 seeks to improve measurement of direct, indirect, and dynamic job impacts of public policies and investments, expanding IFC’s Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring (AIMM) framework to a wider range of World Bank Group operations.",
    "Window 3 focuses on enhancing engagement and outreach between the Jobs Group and stakeholders to influence non-WBG jobs strategies and scale innovative solutions through WBG operations. It emphasizes partnerships between the private sector and WBG, leveraging IFC’s expertise in private investment and job creation, particularly under the IFC 3.0 Creating Markets strategy. An \"Innovation Challenge\" will identify and scale proven job solutions. This window complements others by improving job impact assessments, data access, and coordination across WBG projects and private sector initiatives.",
    "The Jobs MDTF Phase II will build on Phase I by integrating measurement developments across three windows: Window 1 focuses on technical advice and improved project design for jobs interventions; Window 2 emphasizes research, data, and partnerships to enhance jobs measurement and knowledge; Window 3 supports IFC initiatives and innovation challenges to strengthen private sector engagement and solutions.

The program aims to enhance coordination, data quality, and impact measurement across sectors and partners globally.",
    "The JOIN Global Jobs Indicator Data Bank is a standardized repository of 105 key labor market indicators from 1,430 household surveys across 162 countries, primarily low and middle-income. Launched by the World Bank Jobs Group in 2019 and updated in 2020, it includes data from 2,185 surveys with about 228 million observations, all quality-checked. In 2020, a Microsoft Excel-based JOIN benchmarking tool was introduced, allowing users to customize analyses by country, timeline, survey type, and subgroups such as gender, age, and employment type, facilitating detailed labor market diagnostics and cross-country comparisons.",
    "The SEJLS program, launched in July 2019 with over $5 million funding, aims to enhance jobs-relevant policies and large-scale WBG lending operations by better defining and measuring job outcomes. It includes 15 champion projects selected for their strategic focus and potential to address jobs challenges, spanning six WBG Global Practices and two Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas (Gender and FCV). The projects utilize various lending instruments, primarily Investment Project Financing, with some using Program for Results and Development Policy Lending.",
    "SEJLS supports 15 jobs-related projects across five WBG lending regions, with the largest share of funding (63%) in African and South Asian countries. Projects span sectors like agriculture, environment, finance, social protection, and urban resilience, totaling significant active and pipeline investments. SEJLS aims to improve WBG's jobs initiatives by promoting comprehensive job outcome definitions, higher technical standards, and enhanced economic analysis. COVID-19 caused implementation delays but increased the relevance of SEJLS activities, which remain a priority for pandemic labor market recovery efforts.",
    "In 2020, S4YE expanded its activities despite COVID-19, holding two Board meetings with Microsoft becoming the new Chair. They launched and updated a Knowledge Repository with over 300 youth employment tools, adding new categories like Youth with Disabilities and Digital Economy. The team produced thematic reports on jobs in the Orange Economy and digital jobs for youth with disabilities, collaborating with multiple partners. Three Knowledge Briefs addressed youth employment adaptations to COVID-19, incorporating youth voice via technology, and private sector support during the pandemic. Additionally, S4YE introduced a \"How to\" series with two guides on including youth voice and designing SMS outreach in employment programs.",
    "The S4YE team collaborated with the World Bank’s Youth-2-Youth team to host multiple webinars in 2020 focused on youth engagement in program design, remote work accessibility, skills innovation, and sustainable agriculture post-COVID-19. They launched a successful monthly webinar series showcasing private sector partners, attracting 150–220 participants each session and fostering new partnerships. The team enhanced its Impact Portfolio Community of Practice through surveys and consultations, resulting in guidance for adapting youth projects to COVID-19. S4YE also supported various external workshops and events, including those by Nestle, International Outsourcing, and development conferences, while providing technical assistance to internal World Bank teams and IFC.",
    "In 2020, ongoing MDTF grants focused on job creation and economic development in Mozambique, Liberia, and Nepal. Mozambique's Let’s Work Partnership (US$4.6M) advanced studies on agricultural value chains, aggregator firms, a labor market matching platform (Biscate), COVID-19 impacts on firms, and women's training interventions, showing significant gains in entrepreneurship, farming practices, and household income. Liberia's Youth Opportunities Impact Evaluation (US$0.35M) tested the impact of combining skills training with start-up grants, finding increased self-employment and financial inclusion among youth. Nepal's Jobs Platform (US$0.5M) aimed to improve job outcomes for low-income and excluded workers in formal and informal sectors.",
    "The report highlights Nepal's comprehensive diagnostic on job challenges and SME growth potential, with strategic policy recommendations and virtual dissemination due to COVID-19. It improved alignment of World Bank’s Nepal lending portfolio with jobs objectives through the Jobs Impact Measurement tool (JIM) to track project impacts. In Mexico, a $2 million Youth Labor Market Inclusion grant piloted interventions for low-income youth transitioning from education to employment, including labor market literacy workshops and formal employment incentives (FEI). Early results show FEI improves formal employment rates, job stability, salaries, and may have mitigated COVID-19 impacts.",
    "COVID-19 caused a global health and economic crisis, severely disrupting labor markets through illness, mobility restrictions, and reduced demand, leading to job losses, decreased productivity, and income drops. Vulnerable groups like women and youth were disproportionately affected, especially in service and frontline sectors. Recovery is expected to be incomplete through 2020, with unemployment rising significantly. Data collection faces challenges due to pandemic restrictions. The World Bank Group's SEJLS projects and Jobs MDTF initiatives support job creation and skills development in affected sectors across countries like Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Ghana. The JobsWatch initiative uses high-frequency surveys to monitor labor market impacts in developing countries.",
    "The JobsWatch initiative analyzes COVID-19 labor market impacts on workers, households, and firms in developing countries, tracking disruptions, affected worker groups, policy responses, and medium-term economic transformation strategies. It collaborates with World Bank teams and complements international efforts by focusing on developing countries, comparing cross-country outcomes, detailing methodologies, and examining vulnerable groups. Early findings show significant work stoppages (34%), unpaid wages (20%), job changes (9%), and household income losses (62%), with industry and services more affected than agriculture. Phone survey data reveals labor market effects not always reflected in GDP projections, highlighting the need for investment in data infrastructure for timely crisis monitoring.",
    "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant share of workers stopped working, with the highest rates in Bolivia (69%), Tunisia (64%), and Kenya (62%). Lower-income regions and countries generally saw higher shares of work stoppage. Additionally, many wage workers reported partial or no payment, with Indonesia at 57%, Peru and Ecuador at 30%. The S4YE initiative responded by facilitating knowledge sharing and supporting youth employment programs through strategies like scaling virtual operations, remote learning, and MSME support. S4YE's Private Sector Advisory Council helped implement digital skills training, resilience-building for MSMEs, and emergency support. They also hosted peer learning sessions and launched a Youth Advisory Group blog series to highlight youth-led COVID-19 solutions.",
    "The Jobs MDTF Phase II (2021-2025) will focus on large-scale operationalization of the jobs agenda, addressing knowledge gaps, and supporting data-driven understanding of jobs outcomes with disaggregated indicators. It aims to promote best practice exchange, strengthen government and private sector collaboration, and support economic transformation aligned with the JET theme, especially in the poorest countries.

A further analysis on productivity and agglomeration economies is underway using Economic Census and Labor Force Survey data. Activity 2 focuses on analyzing local market failures to determine if policies favor capital- over labor-intensive activities, assessing labor skills, and surveying firms about job creation and COVID-19 impacts in industrial zones.",
    "The project, expected to start between December 2020 and February 2021 and complete by August 2021, involves merging Grant Activities 3 and 4 to focus on spatially-aware interventions for job creation in Upper Egypt. It aims to reduce labor costs to encourage labor-intensive activities, leverage local economic endowments, and measure sustainable private sector job creation linked to the Bank-financed Upper Egypt Program, excluding temporary construction jobs. Progress as of December 2020 shows preparation of Terms of Reference and expert identification. Separately, a Mozambique grant targets gender inequality by evaluating two training interventions—agricultural extension (\"hard skills\") and personal initiative (\"soft skills\")—using an RCT within a feeder road rehabilitation project to improve women smallholder farmers' technology adoption, market access, and entrepreneurship.",
    "A study in Tete province, Mozambique, evaluated two training interventions for 2,240 female farmers across 112 villages along three feeder roads, two of which were rehabilitated under a World Bank project (2017-2019). Villages were randomly assigned to three groups: agriculture extension program only (37 villages), agriculture plus psychology-based personal initiative training (38 villages), and a control group with no intervention (37 villages). Randomization was stratified by road, distance from road, and baseline agricultural yields. Data were collected at baseline (2016) and two follow-ups in 2019 to assess impacts on agricultural outcomes.",
    "In 2020, research showed that Personal Initiative (soft skills) training significantly boosted entrepreneurship among women farmers, doubling profitable off-farm businesses and increasing household income. This training also enhanced the effectiveness of agricultural extension (hard skills), leading to greater cultivation, adoption of improved farming practices, and higher harvest value. Household expenditure increased, with effects persisting post-intervention. Lessons highlight the importance of combining psychological mindset training with technical agricultural education to promote market-oriented farming and entrepreneurship among women. The team is preparing a policy brief and academic paper to disseminate these findings.",
    "The Solutions for Youth Employment (S4YE) initiative supports global collaboration among private, public, and civil society stakeholders to enhance youth employment through knowledge sharing, partnership building, and high-impact programming. In 2020, despite COVID challenges, S4YE expanded activities including thematic reports on the Orange Economy and digital jobs for youth with disabilities, developed toolkits, updated a widely used Knowledge Repository, conducted successful webinars, and supported World Bank Group operations in multiple countries. The initiative also strengthened partnerships across various sectors and with IFC on education and digital skills.",
    "The South Africa Youth Job Search Assistance project examines labor market frictions and imperfect information affecting private sector development, firm productivity, and growth. It involves designing and piloting an online platform with worker profiles, conducting qualitative firm interviews, and running field experiments with Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator. The study tests how sharing information about work seekers' skills influences their self-perception and firms’ hiring decisions, using a \"Skillfinder\" platform with over 6,000 profiles where information to firms is randomly varied to assess impacts on job matching. No lessons learned have been reported yet.",
    "In 2020, all planned data activities and dissemination were completed, including publishing impact evaluation results in multiple academic outlets and creating an implementation manual for skill certification with Harambee. A methodological note on surveying young, mobile work-seekers was produced with JPAL and well received by policymakers. Findings showed that skill certification increased employment, earnings, and accurate self-assessment but did not affect job search behavior, indicating demand-side information frictions are more critical. Labor market services could be partly funded by firms, with similar impacts across genders. The team identified and removed misleading online job posts, highlighting barriers for inexperienced seekers. Results also emphasize the value of incorporating psychology to foster an entrepreneurial mindset in agricultural programs.",
    "The Mexico Youth Labor Market Inclusion Pilot aims to improve employment outcomes for low-income youth graduating from upper secondary school by linking labor market demand and supply and reducing firms' job search and turnover costs. The project uses a multisectoral model involving labor market literacy workshops, a formal employment incentive (FEI) of MXN 900 monthly for up to six months, and remote monitoring. Phase II began in 2019 with 970 youths randomly offered the FEI; 383 registered, 285 reported formal employment, 213 received payments, and 151 completed six months of incentives. Due to COVID-19, the requirement to stay with the same employer was relaxed to allow job changes while maintaining formal employment.",
    "Building trust and continuous communication with youth are key for participation in labor market programs; over half of students plan to work after high school though few schools provide labor market information; most students' work experience is informal. In Côte d’Ivoire, a pilot project integrated rice value chain development with labor and supply-side interventions, involving credit-based input provision and coordination among mills, farmers, and micro-finance institutions without subsidies. Initial challenges led to program adjustments such as limiting participation, streamlining credit, and enhancing agronomic support. Despite no profits for partners, progress was made with benefits from machinery use. COVID-19 and seed quality issues caused setbacks. Further program refinements include stricter participation rules, upfront credit guarantees, decentralized decisions, and marketing support for mills, with early data showing higher profitability for quality \"semi-lux\" rice requiring better paddy quality and management.",
    "Key lessons from the pilot agricultural season include the need for a long-term mindset shift from subsistence to market-oriented farming, the importance of agronomic support, necessity of water control for profitable commercial rice production, and the positive impact of rice marketing on prices. Credit models are often unsuitable in rural areas without farmer organization, and successful contracting requires strong supply chain coordination, collaboration, and adaptability. Risk distribution among all actors remains difficult, while data-driven experiments are essential for policy development. Insights from this pilot informed the design of an IFC rice project in Côte d’Ivoire focusing on large mills.",
    "The \"Let's Work Mozambique\" grant aimed to promote private sector job creation, increase job productivity, and connect people to jobs through a value chain-based approach. It financed four components: jobs diagnostic and policy input, value chain analysis, job pilots, and a knowledge-sharing platform. In 2020, key outputs included a Jobs Strategy Note, Value Chain Book, Mozambique Aggregator Pilot report, and Biscate Study, with dissemination planned for 2021. Lessons highlighted the importance of stakeholder communication, challenges in designing small pilots, and the value of integrating the project with other teams. The project informed youth employment operations and delivered outputs exceeding targets in policy recommendations, pilot operations, data access, studies, job tools, and knowledge sharing.",
