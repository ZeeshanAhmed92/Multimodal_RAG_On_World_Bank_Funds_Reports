**Image Description:**
The image features a simple and clean layout consisting of a large photograph occupying the entire background. The photo captures a close-up scene inside a greenhouse or drying tunnel where various agricultural products—specifically corn cobs and cocoa beans—are being dried. A person's hand is shown using a wooden rake or tool to spread or turn the corn and beans evenly.

The greenhouse structure consists of arched, white translucent polyethylene plastic supported by a frame, allowing natural light to filter inside. The rows of corn cobs are arranged in the background, and the cocoa beans cover the foreground. The hand and tool appear at the right edge of the image.

No text is visible within this image itself, as it focuses solely on the visual representation of the drying process, likely related to agricultural development or food processing in the report. The image provides a strong visual connection to topics around farming practices, crop handling, or rural development in the annual development report.

**Image Description:**
The image shows a woman seated at a table, engaged in beadwork. She is dressed in a red long-sleeved top and wearing a black headband. The woman is holding a wire frame shaped like a star, working on it with beads. On the table in front of her, there are several completed beaded items, including bracelets and necklaces, showcasing intricate patterns with various colors such as yellow, white, black, and red.

In the background, there are windows with bright light coming through, and some indistinct objects and materials suggesting a workshop or craft area. There is text partially visible at the top of the image, painted on the wall in black capital letters, but it is incomplete and not fully readable. The visible portion says: "E KAMPELEY SHA."

The image appears to highlight traditional handicraft work, likely to emphasize cultural heritage and artisanship in the context of the annual development report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report updates progress on the Jobs Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF)-funded activities from 
December 2019 to December 2020:
•	 It summarizes recent WBG efforts to address jobs challenges in client countries that the work 
of the Jobs MDTF complements. 
•	 Further, it presents the core achievements of the Jobs MDTF since its inception and outlines 
the updated strategy for the next Phase II of the fund (2021–2025), as discussed and agreed 
upon with the WBG’s Jobs Steering Committee (JSC) and donor partners in 2019/2020. 
•	 Finally, the report presents progress of active grants between January 1st and December 31st, 
2020 – including the ways that the MDTF has supported the response to the COVID-19 crisis 
– and provides updated financial statements for the MDTF to the end of 2020.
Established in 2014, the Jobs Umbrella Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) supports: 
(i)	
Design and implementation of jobs strategies for World Bank Group (WBG) client countries. 
(ii)	 Advancement of global knowledge on effective policies and activities for sustainable jobs, 
especially for the most vulnerable groups. 
The MDTF is administered by the Jobs Group, a cross-cutting unit seated in the Social Protection 
and Jobs (SPJ) Global Practice (GP) and governed by the WBG-wide JSC.
The MDTF began operations in March 2015 and brought together all WBG trust-funded 
activities on the Jobs agenda under a single umbrella. Its high-level objectives are (i) to support 
WBG client countries in designing high-impact jobs strategies, and (ii) to advance global knowledge 
on effective jobs policies, especially for vulnerable groups. Funds are allocated across five operational 
windows on Jobs Diagnostics and Strategies; Support to Private Sector; Jobs Solutions for Youth; 
Jobs Support in Fragile, Conflict, and Violence (FCV) countries; and Robust Research on Jobs. The 
MDTF awarded 115 grants in 44 countries and 6 regions, valued at US$44.5 million.
Through grants funded through these windows, the MDTF delivered a wide range of outputs. 
These include research studies, data sets, policy notes, empirical tools for jobs estimation and 
technical assistance that leveraged jobs lending operations. The MDTF contributed to results on key 
outcomes summarized below and discussed in detail in this report. More information is available in 
the 2018 and 2019 Jobs MDTF Annual Reports.
The MDTF has improved jobs policy and program design and strengthened policy dialogue on 
jobs among development partners. MDTF grants across different sectors and themes analyzed 
jobs issues and provided recommendations directly integrated into project operations.
Further, the MDTF has supported better integration of the private sector in framing job 
creation and job challenges and solutions. Providing support to the private sector is key to

increasing economic growth and employment opportunities in developing countries. MDTF’s 
Let’s Work partnership has spearheaded support for private sector development.
The MDTF has leveraged a new generation of jobs lending operations. These explicitly focus 
on jobs outcomes, such as jobs creation in the formal sector, improving the quality of informal jobs, 
and connecting vulnerable groups to jobs.
The MDTF has built country stakeholders’ capacity to design and implement jobs policies and 
programs. In just one example, a grant in Ecuador built institutional capacity to create comprehensive 
labor market statistics and foster institutional dialogue by (i) designing and implementing a labor 
demand module for the comprehensive industrial survey; (ii) integrating the labor ministry’s registry 
into the Laboratory for Labor and Business Dynamics data system; (iii) merging industrial surveys 
with that system; and (iv) creating labor demand statistics using data mining.
The MDTF has developed a set of tools, guidance, and methodologies that will strengthen 
jobs analytics and program design. Standardized Job Diagnostics (JDs) were created under 
IDA17 and have taken off across the Bank, with well over 30 countries now having completed or 
started a JD.
The MDTF has strengthened the evidence base on jobs challenges and solutions. This includes 
improved data and/or access to data through new collection, compilation, and dissemination. The 
MDTF co-financed “Haitian Cities—Actions for Today with an Eye on Tomorrow,” which looked at 
the challenges of rapid urbanization in places with high exposure to natural disasters and their 
implications for access to jobs and connectivity.
The MDTF has facilitated knowledge sharing among jobs practitioners and partnerships. 
This includes access to web-based knowledge platforms to support client service delivery. It also 
includes improving knowledge flows, coordinating, and establishing Job Practitioners knowledge 
networks for regular structured knowledge exchange, and holding dissemination events. MDTF 
supported launch of the new website portal for all partnerships and associated knowledge under 
the aegis of the Jobs Group.
Strong, positive WBG-wide response has validated the new Supporting Effective Jobs Lending 
at Scale (SEJLS) approach. Along with the positive response across the WBG, there has been 
wide recognition that such coordination is much needed.
The WBG and develop partners need more rigorous definition and measurement of jobs 
projects outcomes and impacts. Difficulties in accurately measuring jobs results have been a 
barrier to developing effective jobs-focused projects. 
Processes for jobs estimation and results reporting require harmonization and standardization, 
as confirmed during COVID-19 by the large costs associated with lack of coordination. The 
global approach to jobs measurement has been fragmented and inefficient, with different actors 
making uncoordinated progress.
Increased emphasis on outreach, awareness-raising, and consultations is needed. Excellent 
technical outputs, products and reports are necessary, but they may not always be enough to ensure 
stakeholder buy-in, application and use.

Countries display considerable unmet demand for training and capacity building for job 
diagnostics and strategies. Training is more effective when targeted to an appropriate technical 
audience, conducted in a joint team of government and donor representatives, and based on specific 
national data from the country in question. Training has proved to be an effective approach to convey 
solutions.
COVID-19 pandemic labor market disruptions have exacerbated jobs challenges, emphasizing 
the need for innovative solutions and an increased private sector involvement. In developing 
countries, the private sector provides 90 percent of jobs, which are much more negatively affected 
by crises than are public sector jobs.
The cross-cutting nature of the Jobs MDTF has been instrumental in supporting new activities 
and coordinating COVID-19 responses. A JSC, formed by Global Directors across the WBG, is 
the governance mechanism for the Jobs MDTF, advised by the JSC Technical Working Group. Over 
the reporting period, the JSC met regularly to manage allocation of Jobs-MDTF resources and to 
discuss progress on underlining activities.
With the agreement of donors and the JSC, in 2020 the Jobs MDTF extended its planning 
horizon to a second phase (Phase II, 2021–2025) and agreed to raise an additional 
US$53 million. The additional funding would complete the US$100 million funding goal originally 
agreed between the World Bank and donors. The renewed Jobs MDTF strategy confirms the original 
objectives of the fund and strengthens support to large-scale operationalization of the jobs agenda, 
while continuing to support innovative work to address knowledge gaps.
During Phase II, the Jobs MDTF will be restructured into three operational windows: 
(1)	 Jobs Lending at Scale: Will provide resources to task teams to help scale-up the WBG’s 
jobs lending portfolio across sectors and regions. Key objectives will be: (i) improve technical 
capacity of operations to improve targeting of jobs outcome in key sectors; (ii) scale-up 
operational approaches targeting jobs outcomes, especially in low-income and fragile settings; 
and (iii) standardize operational approaches to jobs challenges in client countries and frame a 
WBG-wide integrated jobs strategy.
(2)	 Measurement: This window will enable evidence-based jobs initiatives. Key objectives will 
be: (i) upgrade country-level data and diagnostics on jobs outcomes to enable evidence-based 
jobs initiatives; and (ii) advance the technical capacity for measuring jobs outcomes to provide 
policymakers with improved information on expected benefits of interventions.
(3)	 Partnership and Innovation: This window will support engagement and dissemination 
outreach between the Jobs Group and key stakeholders. Key objectives will be: (i) influence 
non-WBG jobs strategies by convening key stakeholders to learn from MDTF outputs; and (ii) 
identify and accelerate cutting-edge solutions to emerging jobs challenges, and scaling them 
through WBG operations.

2020 PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS
JOIN is a Global Jobs Indicator Data Bank—a standardized repository of key labor market 
indicators—for WB staff and policymakers. The WB Jobs Group launched JOIN in 2019 and 
updated it in 2020. After the latest update, the current version of JOIN uses 2,185 surveys totaling 
about 228 million observations. The surveys are drawn from a dedicated and standardized World Bank 
survey compilation focusing on labor indicators, called the International Income Distribution Data 
Set (I2D2). Additionally, in 2020 the team launched a new Microsoft Excel-based JOIN benchmarking 
tool giving users more options to customize analysis.
The Supporting Effective Jobs Lending (SEJLS) program started implementing activities 
across its “champion projects.” SEJLS responds to the need to better define and measure 
outcomes and benefits of jobs relevant policies and programs; as such, it focuses on leveraging 
large‑scale WBG lending operations and improving design consistency of their jobs-relevant 
components and estimation of jobs outcomes. of SEJLS incorporated 15 “champion projects” 
representing strategic and jobs-relevant WBG business lines into its first round, and began 
implementation of project activities. Many of these projects had to adapt their focus to address 
emerging COVID-19 pandemic challenges.
The Solutions for Youth Employment (S4YE) team further scaled-up S4YE activities across 
all pillars of the work program. A full-fledged S4YE Knowledge Repository for Youth Employment 
Practitioners, created and launched in 2019, hosts WBG as well as S4YE partner-developed tools. 
S4YE launched a new “How-to Series” to provide a quick step-by-step guide in 1–2 pages for 
practitioners and policymakers designing new youth employment programs. The team published 
two How-to Notes in 2020 in partnership with the World Bank’s Mexico Youth Labor Market Inclusion 
(MYLMI) project. The S4YE team continued to build and deepen partnerships. In an effort to 
strengthen partnership with private sector, S4YE launched a series of monthly webinars highlighting 
the work of a private sector partner each month, bring insights and lessons to WBG teams.
In Mozambique, the Jobs Group continued its engagement. Through the Let’s Work Partnership 
Country Pilot, the Jobs Group Jobs Strategy Note integrated recommended policy and program 
actions from the Let’s Work program’s activities. The MDTF also supported the Improving Jobs 
of Smallholder Women Farmers grant in Mozambique funding the design and implementation of 
two training interventions targeted at female farmers in the context of a feeder road rehabilitation 
program led by a World Bank (WB) operation in Tete province, Mozambique.
In Liberia, the Youth Opportunities Impact Evaluation (IE) Grant addresses key questions 
on how to cost-effectively promote self-employment and entrepreneurship in fragile and 
conflict-affected states. Preliminary results indicate that self-employment, financial inclusion, and 
ownership of business assets increased among beneficiaries in treatment groups compared to the 
control group.
In Nepal, the Jobs Platform supports delivery of better jobs outcomes, both in the formal and 
the informal sector, especially for low-income workers and excluded groups. In 2020, the team 
published an small and medium enterprise (SME) study, “Market Study to Understand Job Growth 
Potential in SMEs in Nepal,” which was central to the labor demand analysis in the Jobs Diagnostic. 
The second main outcome is improved alignment of the Nepal lending portfolio with jobs objectives.

This was achieved through an assessment of the current portfolio mapping the World Bank (WB) 
against the three-pillar Jobs Conceptual Framework (JCF) for monitoring creation of more, better, 
and more inclusive jobs.
In Mexico, the Youth Labor Market Inclusion grant designs, pilots, and evaluates innovative 
approaches to improve employment outcomes for low-income youth graduates. The 
beneficiaries are graduates from upper secondary education and transitioning into the labor market. 
Early IE results show that formal employment incentives (FEI) improve the probability of graduates 
being formally employed in the short-term, and increase job stability and access to the formal 
labor market.
NEXT STEPS
Initiate the Jobs MDTF’s Phase II implementation during the 2021–2025 period. Responding to 
the ambition of IDA donors and governments, during Phase II, the MDTF will focus on supporting 
large-scale operationalization of the jobs agenda, while continuing to support an innovative work 
program to address knowledge gaps.
Continue to implement the SEJLS program and invest in understanding jobs outcomes 
through data and analytics. The MDTF will continue to strengthen the design consistency of 
jobs-relevant project components and estimation of jobs outcomes. 
Promote exchange of best practices and lessons from MDTF outputs and tools to help build 
development partners’ capacity. Beyond the WBG, it is crucial to reinforce the broader discussion 
on improving jobs outcomes with development partners and government and private sector actors. 
An important Jobs Group and Jobs MDTF role is to support dialogue between government agencies 
charged with addressing the jobs agenda—such as job creation commissions, competitiveness 
councils, and national training agencies—and leverage private sector involvement to identify 
opportunities for, and constraints to, accelerated job creation.
Maximizing linkages to the Jobs and Economic Transformation (JET) theme, focusing on the 
poorest countries. Successful transformation means responding to evolving technology and skills 
demand while taking account of economies’ resource endowments and comparative advantages. 
The Jobs MDTF will play a key role in supporting JET operationalization during Phase II by improving 
conceptual framing of a growing pipeline of WBG projects addressing jobs. It will also support 
improved measurement of jobs effects by contributing to efforts to estimate indirect jobs effects 
from WBG operations.
Advance the Jobs-After-COVID workstream. Building on lessons learned through the JobsWatch 
initiative and other fund activities mobilized in response to COVID-19, the Jobs Umbrella MDTF will 
continue focusing on the medium-term prospects for accelerating jobs transitions in developing 
countries in the aftermath of the pandemic. This workstream will build on the recently launched 
Jobs-After-COVID call for proposals, which aims to identify and accelerate pioneering diagnosis of, 
and solutions to, post-pandemic jobs challenges.

THE JOBS MULTI-DONOR TRUST FUND (MDTF) 
PHASE I
Since the inception of the Jobs MDTF, its activities have contributed directly to shaping 
and implementing the jobs agenda across the World Bank Group (WBG), leveraging 
complementarities with various initiatives. The Jobs MDTF has delivered a wide range of outputs 
that include studies, data sets, policy notes, empirical tools for jobs estimation, and technical 
assistance leveraging World Bank jobs lending operations. (Annex 1 summarizes the cumulative 
progress of the fund grants and Annex 2 covers beneficiaries).1 The Jobs Umbrella MDTF’s work 
aims to support the Bank’s broader effort to prioritize the Jobs Agenda (see Box 1.1).
BOX 1.1 
PRIORITIZING THE JOBS AGENDA AT THE WBG
The global movement to end poverty and boost shared prosperity hinges in large part on the types 
of jobs people have. For many countries, increasing labor force participation rates and ensuring 
that workers have access to good quality jobs will continue to be a challenge for many years. In 
response to emerging global jobs challenges, in recent years the WBG has prioritized its engagement 
by launching initiatives that complement the work of the Jobs MDTF in supporting WBG clients’ 
progress on the Jobs Agenda.
Creating better jobs for more people is the ultimate objective of a significant share of WBG 
programs and interventions. Yet some initiatives merit particular consideration by virtue of their 
consequences on labor market and related development outcomes. Key WBG jobs initiatives, include 
the International Development Association’s Jobs and Economic Transformation (IDA JET) special 
theme, the Human Capital Project (HCP), as well as the increased focus on market and job creation 
under IFC’s 3.0 corporate strategy. 
The JET special theme was introduced during IDA18 replenishment in 2017. Following the IDA17 
Inclusive Growth theme, IDA participants asked the WBG to take a more targeted approach on the 
jobs economic transformation agenda through deliberate and coordinated interventions supporting 
structural transformation, private sector-led job creation, increased job quality, and better inclusion 
of women and youth. 
The JET approach starts with sound foundations that provide the incentives for private sector 
actors to invest, hire and grow. It includes macro-financial stability, strong institutions, a business 
environment that levels the playing field for all enterprises, access to enabling infrastructure services, 
1	 Previous Jobs MDTF Annual Reports also cover these issues extensively.

and a stable and inclusive financial sector. The JET approach emphasizes three primary channels 
for raising productivity: 
(i)	
Encouraging reallocation of resources towards more productive activities and diversification 
into new sectors and products with potential to create more and better jobs and create new 
markets. Sectors with high potential to contribute to transformation vary by country, but higher 
value-added agriculture and light manufacturing can contribute in many IDA countries.
(ii)	 Expanding access to larger markets through trade and urbanization and deepen linkages 
between firms to make such integration inclusive. 
(iii)	 Upgrading existing jobs and enterprises to be more productive, with an emphasis on adopting 
new technologies and strengthening worker skills. Raising productivity and earnings is the 
most important pathway out of poverty—it is how development is achieved. 
FIGURE 1.1
Expanding Productivity Channels to Create Better Jobs for More People
The Human Capital Project (HCP) launched in 2017 represents a global effort to accelerate 
more and better investments in people for greater equity and economic growth. Credible 
measurement of education and health outcomes raises the importance of human capital locally, 
nationally, and globally. Measurement spurs demand for policy interventions to build human 
capital in countries where governments are not doing enough. Good measurement is essential to 
developing research and analysis to inform the design of policies to improve human capital. With 
this goal in mind, the World Bank launched the human capital project in 2017, a program of advocacy, 
measurement, and analytical work to raise awareness and increase demand for interventions to 
build human capital. The project has three components: 
(i)	
A cross-country metric: The Human Capital Index (HCI). The HCI quantifies the contribution 
of health and education to the productivity of the next generation of workers. Countries can

use it to assess how much income they are foregoing because of human capital gaps, and 
how much faster they can turn these losses into gains if they act now.
(ii)	 Measurement and research to inform policy action. Within countries, measurement leads 
to insights into what works and where to target resources. It also increases policy makers’ 
awareness of the importance of investing in human capital, creating momentum for action. 
Globally, comprehensive measurement sheds light on the differences between countries, and 
spurs demand for investment in people.
(iii)	 Support for country strategies to accelerate investment in human capital. The HCP 
helps countries tackle the worst barriers to human capital development, using a “whole of 
government” approach.
The HCP helps create the political space for national leaders to prioritize transformational 
human capital investments. Ministers from close to 30 pilot countries presented early ideas on 
how to accelerate investments, followed by a rare opportunity for their staff to work across regions 
and sectors in person. The number of countries actively participating in the project has grown to over 
40 as of 2019. The objective is rapid progress towards a world in which all children arrive in school 
well-nourished and ready to learn, can expect to attain real learning in the classroom, and are able 
to enter the job market as healthy, skilled, and productive adults.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has enhanced its focus on the job-creating 
impacts of its funding. Specifically, IFC’s corporate strategy (IFC 3.0) focuses the institution on 
creating markets and mobilizing private capital, with increased support to countries where private 
capital flows are inadequate to address major development gaps, such as the need for more, better, 
and inclusive jobs (see Box 1.2).
IFC investments have begun to measure job creation outcomes, particularly direct and indirect 
jobs. Through its financial market investments and advisory services, IFC has focused on SMEs and 
on strengthening backward and forward linkages from its investments; the IFC 3.0 strategy further 
reinforces upstream, market-creating activities. The joint IFC-WB Country Private Sector Diagnostics 
(CPSD) workstream analyzes job-led growth potential across a range of economic sectors in which 
IFC invests, including (i) real sectors (manufacturing, agribusiness, and services), (ii) finance, and 
(iii) infrastructure. Further, the ability to assess development impact and market creation potential 
before the start of a project—achieved by the Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring 
(AIMM) system—has influenced IFC’s project selection and design and will lead to more projects 
that can create markets.

KEY IFC JOBS PROGRAMS
The joint IFC and International Labour Organization (ILO) Better Work program (www.betterwork.org) 
aims to improve working conditions in garment factories. Better Work trains local enterprise 
advisors to assist factories comply with national labor laws and international standards through 
unannounced assessment, and advisory and training services. Since its inception, Better Work 
has undertaken activities in nine countries, with eight countries having established programs 
(Cambodia, Haiti, Jordan, Lesotho, Indonesia, Vietnam, Nicaragua, and Bangladesh). The program 
has three components:
(i)	
Compliance Assessment Activities in factories: auditors evaluate if the factories are adhering 
to ILO Core Labor Standards and national labor laws.
(ii)	 Continuous Improvement: Better Work staff facilitates dialogue between managers and 
workers to address their report’s findings and submits regular progress reports.
(iii)	 Stakeholder engagement: buy-in for the program and activities occurs at all levels, including 
government, employers, unions and workers, and international buyers.
The program is run by the ILO with IFC being part of the management team providing both 
investment services and discrete advisory initiatives. One such program is Gender Equality and 
Returns (GEAR ) for the Manufacturing sector. GEAR unlocks career progression opportunities for 
female sewing operators through training to advance into supervisory roles, with training including 
a mix of technical, managerial, team building, and “soft” skills.
IFC’s GenderSmart Business Solutions provide clients with the tools and resources to 
strengthen gender inclusion within their operations, resolve labor issues, increase employee 
engagement and enhance company performance. IFC is an established and leading partner for 
global private sector entities proving the business case for inclusive jobs through gender equality, 
with programs such as the SheWorks Global Partnership and Tackling Childcare.

SheWorks Global Partnership
Tackling Childcare
Led by IFC’s Gender Secretariat and 
supported with technical expertise from 
three strategic partners—including the 
EDGE Certified Foundation, ILO, and the 
UN Women’s Empowerment Principles—
SheWorks is a hands-on project focused 
on activating policies to advance women’s 
employment and promotion. SheWorks 
members represent a variety of regions and 
sectors and regularly share knowledge and 
best practices. Members are conducting 
firm-level gender assessments, instituting 
mentorship and sponsorship programs to 
foster women’s leadership, setting effective 
anti-sexual-harassment mechanisms, and 
providing flexible working arrangements.
IFC’s series of Tackling Childcare reports 
spanning Bangladesh, Cambodia, Fiji, India, 
Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and 
other countries demonstrate a strong business 
case for employers to meet employee 
childcare needs. IFC research shows that 
family-friendly workplace policies such as 
childcare, flexible work, and paid leave can 
enable firms to attract and retain talent and 
boost productivity and profits. To accelerate 
implementation and raise awareness, IFC 
recently led the Global Tackling Childcare 
Working Group of more than 30 organizations 
to share knowledge and develop guidance for 
employers, including the Guide for Employer-
Supported Childcare as well as Childcare in 
the COVID‑19 Era: A Guide for Employers.
CORE ACHIEVEMENTS
The Jobs MDTF began operations in March 2015 and brought together all the WBG trust-
funded activities on the Jobs agenda under a single umbrella. Its high-level objectives are to (i) 
support WBG client countries design high-impact jobs strategies, and (ii) advance global knowledge 
on effective jobs policies, especially for vulnerable groups. Funds are allocated across five operational 
windows: Jobs Diagnostics and Strategies, Support to Private Sector, Jobs Solutions for Youth, Jobs 
Support in Fragile, Conflict and Violence (FCV) countries, and Robust Research on Jobs. The MDTF 
awarded 115 grants in 44 countries and six regions valued at US$44.5 million.
Grants helped deliver a wide range of outputs including research studies, data sets, policy notes, 
empirical tools for jobs estimation, and technical assistance on World Bank jobs lending operations. 
MDTF contributed to results on seven jobs outcomes, some of which are highlighted here. (More 
details are available in the 2018 and 2019 Jobs MDTF Annual Reports). 
Outcome 1: Improved Coordination of Jobs Polices and Programs. 
The MDTF improved jobs policy and program design and strengthened the jobs policy dialogue 
among development partners. MDTF grants across different sectors and themes analyzed Jobs 
issues and provided recommendations to directly integrate into project operations. Examples include:

•	 MDTF funded “Job Creation in the Private Sector: An Exploratory Assessment of Patterns and 
Determinants at the Macro, Sector, and Firm Levels” study showed that overall, more jobs 
are generated in economies where formal job creation is more responsive to growth cycles. 
Findings of this paper are being implemented in Bangladesh through Jobs Development Policy 
Operations (DPOs), which support broad-based policy reforms in the country. 
•	 The Jobs MDTF also supported the “Exports to Jobs: Boosting the Gains from Trade in South 
Asia” study estimating the potential impact from increasing South Asian trade on total and 
wage employment and earnings. The results suggest that providing incentives for increasing 
labor‑intensive production in tradable goods and services would result in more wage employment 
and less casual work. These findings highlight the potential of increased trade openness to 
address the jobs deficits facing South Asia. 
•	 The Jobs Group also developed Jobs Solutions Notes based on evidence drawn from research, 
impact evaluations, pilots, and operations. Jobs Group technical experts collaborated with other 
WB experts to author the Notes, which are succinct, actionable, and go beyond a literature 
review. While the methodology for each Note was similar—literature review, portfolio analysis, 
and consultations—the range of evidence and scale of application vary considerably.
Outcome 2: Mainstreaming the Private Sector in the Jobs Agenda. 
The MDTF has supported a stronger recognition of the private sector role in framing jobs challenges 
and solutions. Providing support to the private sector is key to increasing economic growth and 
employment opportunities in developing countries. The MDTF’s Let’s Work partnership spearheaded 
its support to private sector development:
•	 In Zambia, the Let’s Work Program analyzed poultry and aquaculture value chains and highlighted 
the potential to expand small-scale farmer income in the sector. The report concludes that 
policies to unlock job growth potential in the sector will need to focus on enabling more farmers 
to participate in commercial markets through increasing quantities and improving quality. 
•	 In Mozambique, the Let’s Work program studied the cassava, cashew, and plantation forestry 
value chains to understand the potential for inclusive private sector-led job creation integrating 
farmers into agribusiness. The team also developed a policy note highlighting challenges that 
need to be overcome to accelerate structural transformation in Mozambique. 
•	 Outside of the Let’s Work initiative, IFC’s Tackling Childcare grant built evidence on the business 
case for provision of gender-smart childcare services in the workplace. It also provided ideas on 
how the private sector can adopt such policies.
Outcome 3: Leveraging Innovative Operations for Job Creation. 
The MDTF has leveraged a new generation of World Bank jobs lending operations with an explicit 
focus on jobs outcomes, such as job creation in the formal sector, improving the quality of informal 
jobs, and connecting vulnerable groups to jobs. For example:
•	 In the Solomon Islands, the Training Women in SolTuna (TWIST) operation improved the 
employability of women in the tuna industry through demand-driven skills training and 
partnership with the private sector. An IFC investment client since 2013, SolTuna employs over 
1,800 workers, 64 percent of whom are women. Advisory work included a gender diagnostic,

qualitative and quantitative research, and interventions to understand and address root causes 
of absenteeism and turnover, and provision of financial literacy and other life-skills training to 
workers. 
•	 In Tunisia, a new, multi-sector youth jobs investment lending operation—approved based on 
inputs from the MDTF through the Let’s Work Tunisia country pilot)—supports integrated supply 
and demand-side interventions to improve jobs opportunities in lagging regions and marginalized 
peri-urban areas. On the supply side, the project addresses barriers (incentives, information, 
skills, and mobility) youth face in accessing jobs or moving to higher-quality jobs. On the demand 
side, the project provides matching grants and business support services, conditional on job 
creation, to existing and new enterprises in selected value chains. 
The MDTF has also supported operations to address policy constraints to better jobs outcomes. 
•	 In Jordan, the Jobs Group is leading the First Equitable Growth and Job Creation Development 
Policy Financing. This US$500 million policy-based lending operation helps Jordan lay the 
foundation for a higher and more sustainable economic growth path, while creating more jobs 
both for Jordanians and for non-Jordanian refugees and migrants. 
•	 In July 2019, following consultations with the Jobs MDTF donor partners and the JSC, the MDTF 
launched the Supporting Effective Jobs Lending at Scale (SEJLS) program. SEJLS responds to 
the need to better define and measure outcomes and impacts of jobs relevant policies and 
programs; as such, it focuses on leveraging large-scale WBG lending operations and improving 
design consistency of their jobs-relevant components and estimation of jobs outcomes. Fifteen 
champion projects representing strategic and jobs-relevant WBG business lines have been 
incorporated into the first round of SEJLS with funding of just over US$5 million. 
Outcome 4: Building Stakeholder Capacity. 
MDTF grants have helped build country stakeholders’ capacity to design and implement jobs policies 
and programs: 
•	 In Ecuador, an MDTF grant helped build institutional capacity to create comprehensive labor 
market statistics and foster institutional dialogue by (i) designing and implementing a labor 
demand module for the comprehensive industrial survey, (ii) integrating the labor ministry’s 
registry into the Laboratory for Labor and Business Dynamics data system, (ii) merging industrial 
surveys with that system, and (iv) creating labor demand statistics using data mining. 
•	 In Sierra Leone, an MDTF grant supported design and implementation of the 2016 Labor Force 
Survey (LFS) and production of an analytical report on jobs in Sierra Leone, relying on the 
2014 and 2016 LFS data. Support to the statistical agency included design, sampling, and a 
methodological approach for data collection of the 2016 LFS. 
•	 The Jobs Core Course learning event in 2018 and 2019 provided in-depth understanding of the 
conceptual and practical issues involved in the design and implementation of jobs strategies 
and interventions. The over 100 policy makers attending the event drew knowledge and lessons 
from many MDTF funded activities.

## Page 25
Outcome 5: Developing New Methods to Estimate Jobs Effects. 
The MDTF has developed a set of tools, guidance, and methodologies to strengthen jobs analytics 
and program design. 
•	 The use of Standardized Job Diagnostics (JDs), created under IDA17, have proliferated across 
the World Bank, with well over 30 countries now having completed or started a JD. 
•	 The MDTF-funded Jobs M&E Toolkit provides a package of resources for project teams to support 
mainstreaming the Jobs Agenda in WBG lending operations. It provides guidance on results 
indicators and simple tools for jobs data collection without the burden of resource‑intensive 
survey efforts. 
•	 The MDTF-funded COVID-19 JobsWatch initiative helped inform labor market policy responses 
during the crisis as it evolves and to prepare for recovery. The development objective is to 
synthesize and generate new evidence on COVID-19 labor market effects on workers, 
households, and firm, and to track policy responses to the economic crisis.2 
Outcome 6: Improved Evidence and Knowledge Base on Jobs. 
The MDTF has strengthened the evidence base on jobs challenges and solutions, included improving 
data and/or access to data through new collection, compilation, and dissemination. 
•	 In Haiti, the MDTF co-financed “Haitian Cities—Actions for Today with an Eye on Tomorrow” 
looked at the challenges rapid urbanization poses in places with high exposure to natural 
disasters and their implications for access to jobs and connectivity. The study used an innovative 
methodology – using on cell-phone call records to identify job and home locations of residents 
of Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haïtien—to assess commuting challenges and barriers to accessing 
opportunities in Haitian cities. The study received the World Bank President’s 2018 Award for 
Excellence in the category of Disruptive Technologies. 
•	 In Kenya, an MDTF grant assessed a common concern that directly helping small businesses 
to grow comes at the expense of unassisted competitors. Using a two-stage randomized 
experiment, the study found no evidence of negative spillovers on competing businesses, and 
the markets appear to have grown in terms of number of customers and sales volumes. 
•	 In Turkey, another MDTF grant examined the quality of management practices and its relation to 
other firm-level characteristics such as firm performance, competition, and type of ownership. 
The study found that management quality correlates with productivity and quality of jobs across 
manufacturing subsectors. The study also concluded that factors such as firm size, level of 
human capital of the workforce, export intensity of the firm, openness to international markets, 
level of hierarchy in decision making, and degree of managerial autonomy are important 
determinants of managerial practices. 
Outcome 7: Improved Knowledge Sharing and Leveraging. 
The MDTF has facilitated knowledge sharing among jobs practitioners and partnerships. This 
includes access to web-based knowledge platforms to support client service delivery. It also includes 
2	 Early findings from JobsWatch suggest that 34 percent of respondents reported stopping work, 20 percent of 
wage workers reported lack of payment for work performed, 9 percent reported job changes due to the pandemic, 
and 62 percent reported income loss in their household.

improving knowledge flows, coordinating and establishing Job Practitioners knowledge networks 
for regular structured knowledge exchange and holding dissemination events. The MDTF-supported 
launch of the new website portal for all Jobs Group partnerships and associated knowledge provides 
a single access point for the Jobs Umbrella MDTF, the LWP, the Solutions for Youth Employment 
(S4YE) partnership, and the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development. The 
resources section of each subsite allows access to a significant repository of knowledge, research, 
analysis, and tools. Jobs Data Visualization App allows users to customize charts and explore jobs 
indicators. It is based on the Global Micro Database to Track the Labor Market Outcomes of the 
Poor (the International Income Distribution Database), for which the MDTF grant contributed to jobs 
analytical work by adding variables on migration and second jobs in all 1,300 database surveys. The 
Jobs Group also launched JOIN—a Global Jobs Indicator Data Bank, a standardized repository of 
key labor market indicators for WB staff and policymakers. JOIN supports (i) regional jobs reports 
with time series trends based on WB microdata; (ii) better incorporation of information from WB 
microdata, such as household income and expenditure surveys in the Global Monitoring Database, 
WB Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS), and Labor Force Surveys; and (iii) Adding jobs 
indicators into the Development Economics (DEC) data repository for broader use. 
KEY LESSONS LEARNED
The activities and projects implemented over the Jobs MDTF’s first phase (2015–2020) contributed 
to a large body of knowledge beyond outputs produced. They highlight strengths and weaknesses in 
project or program preparation, design, and implementation that affect performance, outcome, and 
impact. Some key lessons learned from the Jobs MDTF so far are summarized here, emphasizing 
strategic implications for the MDTF’s second phase.
WBG strong positive response validated the new Supporting Effective Jobs Lending at 
Scale (SEJLS) approach. Strong response across the WBG to the SEJLS approach includes wide 
recognition that such coordination is much needed. The SELJS selection approach for “champion 
projects”—consisting in working directly with GPs and IFC leadership rather than through a WBG 
Intranet-wide “call for proposals”—has proven effective in targeting projects reflecting important 
WBG business lines that influence jobs outcomes in client countries.
The World Bank and its development partners need more rigorous definition and 
measurement of jobs project outcomes and effects. Difficulties in accurately measuring jobs 
results have been a barrier to developing effective jobs-focused projects. To capture the development 
benefits of jobs‑relevant interventions and to estimate economy-wide effects, it is necessary to 
go beyond estimating direct jobs created to include indirect jobs (that is, jobs created in suppliers 
and distributors) and induced jobs (such as jobs from business expansions made possible by 
infrastructure investments and policy reforms).
Processes for jobs estimation and results reporting need to be harmonized and standardized, 
as confirmed during COVID-19 pandemic. The fragmented global approach to jobs measurement 
during the COVID-19 pandemic has been inefficient, with different actors—development finance 
institutions, international organizations, nonprofits, and practitioners—making uncoordinated 
progress. Strengthening understanding of economy-wide effects from jobs strategies and

## Page 27
interventions, including through better development impact measurement and monitoring, 
represents a global public good. 
Increased emphasis on outreach, awareness-raising, and consultations is needed. Excellent 
technical outputs, products, and reports are necessary, but may not always be enough to ensure 
stakeholder buy-in and that they will apply findings. This underlines the importance of outreach, 
awareness-raising, and consultations, in addition to grant support. More investment is needed in 
dialogue, coordination, communication, and knowledge sharing among client representatives as 
well as WBG staff and donors at all levels: policy, project design, and measurement.  
World Bank client countries have considerable unmet demand for training and capacity 
building to conduct job diagnostics and strategies. Training is more effective when targeted to an 
appropriate technical audience; conducted in a joint team of government and donor representatives; 
and based on specific national country data. Training has proved to be an effective approach to 
convey solutions.
COVID-19 labor market disruptions exacerbated jobs challenges, emphasizing the need for 
innovative solutions and increased private sector involvement. The private sector in developing 
countries create 90 percent of jobs, and these jobs are much more affected by a crisis such as 
a pandemic than are public sector jobs. Developing countries urgently need special attention to 
private sector job creation and protection, especially micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). 
All categories of workers require support, but some groups have been hit particularly hard by the 
pandemic, such as women, particularly due to the service sector downturn. Young people are also 
very negatively affected; more than four in ten young people employed globally worked in hard-
hit sectors when the crisis began. These jobs challenges are especially severe in IDA countries, 
combining daunting pre-COVID unemployment and informality rates with limited financial capacity 
to support recovery plans.
The cross-cutting nature of the Jobs MDTF has been instrumental in supporting new activities 
and coordinating COVID-19 responses. The Jobs Steering Committee (JSC), formed by Global 
Directors across the WBG, is the governance mechanism for the Jobs MDTF, advised by the JSC 
Technical Working Group. Over the reporting period, the JSC met regularly to manage allocation of 
Jobs MDTF resources and to discuss progress on underlining activities. Beyond administration of 
the Jobs MDTF portfolio, an important JSC function is to coordinate jobs responses across WBG 
sectoral interventions. In the context of the selection and review of SEJLS champion projects, JSC 
members convened and discussed the best operational avenues to tackle jobs challenges. When 
the Covid crisis occurred, the JSC provided a forum for discussion, feedback, and coordination of 
the several sectoral responses initiated in response to the emergency.

THE JOBS MDTF PHASE II
OBJECTIVES
While there was already significant demand in WBG countries for support on jobs programs, 
COVID-19 has cast a sharp light on the importance of enacting effective jobs strategies. 
The pandemic represents an opportunity to address some obstacles to better jobs outcomes, 
although pandemic employment effects depend on policy responses, which could lead to severe 
and long-lasting negative effects if policies are not timely or effective. In this context, improving our 
understanding of jobs outcomes and of what programs benefit people remains a priority.
At the same time, pandemic disruptions and the speed with which the crisis has unfolded 
have created new measurement challenges. Measurement methods and sources normally used 
to track labor market outcomes showed significant shortcomings. Furthermore, social distancing 
and other disease transmission prevention measures have affected several data-related activities 
around the world degrading data availability, quality, and reliability.3 
The JSC and its donors agreed in 2020 to extend the MDTF planning horizon to a second 
Phase (Phase II, 2021–2025) and agreed to raise an additional US$53 million. This completes 
the US$100 million funding goal originally agreed between the World Bank and donors. A strategy 
document for the next Phase II was discussed and agreed with the JSC (September 17th, 2020) 
and donors (September 30th, 2020). 
The Phase II strategy document maintains the two original objectives of the Jobs MDTF:
(i)	
To support the design and implementation of comprehensive, integrated, and high-impact jobs 
strategies for WBG client countries.
(ii)	 To advance global knowledge on the most effective policies and activities for sustainable jobs, 
especially for the most vulnerable groups.
However, there are important shifts in emphasis: The Phase II strategy will focus on supporting 
large-scale operationalization of the jobs agenda while continuing to support innovative work 
to address knowledge gaps. During Phase II, the MDTF will also increase outreach efforts to 
maximize learning from implementation of its activities. Beyond the objectives of each workstream, 
it will reflect the following overarching principles: 
•	 Be an integrated, cross-cutting facility, focused on activities that might not be prioritized by 
other funding streams.
•	 Establish a medium-term jobs agenda for developing countries (LICs and MICs) that reflects 
and internalizes the multiple impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

•	 Take account of the private sector development potential of jobs-relevant operations and 
create incentives for private sector investors to replicate and scale such investments.
•	 Focus on closing gender gaps in jobs outcomes, such as labor force participation, employment, 
and earnings.
•	 Support access to jobs for vulnerable groups, with strong attention to youth, fragility, minority 
groups, and people with disabilities. 
•	 Ensure coherent linkages with related WBG strategic priorities, including:
	›
Operationalization of the 2019 WDR on The Changing Nature of Work and the WBG strategy 
for FCV 2020–2025.
	›
Implementation of the IDA19 JET Special Theme and the WBG Gender Strategy’s jobs pillar.
	›
Related WBG and donor community agendas, including the Human Capital Project (HCP), 
Universal Social Protection 2030, and the Africa “digital moonshot” agenda.
•	 Generating solutions relevant across geographical regions and country contexts by reflecting 
the different nature of jobs challenges experienced.
PROGRAM COMPONENTS
The MDTF began operation in March 2015, bringing together all WBG trust-funded activities on the 
jobs agenda under a single umbrella. The fund originally allocated resources across five operational 
windows: 
•	 Window 1: Jobs Diagnostics, Strategies and Operations—develop and implement jobs 
strategies for specific country challenges, building on the deliverables of the other windows.
•	 Window 2: Job Creation through the Private Sector (Let’s Work Partnership, or LWP)—
support private-sector-led job growth, building on country pilots and measurement work. 
•	 Window 3: Jobs and Youth—build jobs solutions for young people and strengthen the global 
knowledge base on youth employment.
•	 Window 4: Jobs in Fragile, Conflict, and Violence (FCV) Situations—support employment 
generation through diagnostics, innovative interventions, and international partner coordination.
•	 Window 5: Actionable and Robust Research—in partnership with the International Labor 
Organization (ILO) and the World Bank Development Economics Vice Presidency, implement 
rigorous research focusing on key policy questions to support the other windows. 
During Phase II, the Jobs MDTF will be restructured into 3 operational windows, as described below 
(Figure 2.1).

FIGURE 2.1
Expanding Productivity Channels to Create Better Jobs for More People
Window 1—Jobs Lending at Scale 
This window will provide resources to task teams to help scale the WBG’s jobs lending 
portfolio across sectors and regions. Key objectives will be: (i) improve the technical quality of 
operations to improve targeting of jobs outcome in key sectors; (ii) scale-up operational approaches 
targeting jobs outcomes, especially in low-income and fragile settings; and (iii) standardize 
operational approaches to jobs challenges in client countries and frame a WBG-wide integrated 
jobs strategy.
It is increasingly important for the WBG and donor community to show a development 
benefit and “value for money” by measuring how investments contribute to jobs and 
earnings outcomes. Through joint engagement of the Jobs Group with WBG operational teams, 
and by validating lending intervention models across sectors, this approach is expected to inform 
development of good quality, context-specific jobs strategies and operations.
The Jobs MDTF funds will strengthen consistency of jobs-relevant project and components 
design and jobs outcomes estimation in Results Frameworks. Targeted jobs indicators will 
vary across project types, but could include direct, indirect, and induced effects on the quantity and 
quality of jobs and indicators by beneficiary characteristics (males/females disaggregated by age, 
education, location, ethnicity/race, disability, and other relevant characteristics). 
Window 1 will build on the SEJLS pilot.4 The launch of the SEJLS program has generated 
great interest among WBG operational units. GP, CCSA, and IFC leaders represented in the JSC 
have supported the view that the SEJLS program represents an opportunity to efficiently scale 
the WBG’s jobs strategy by leveraging existing and planned large-scale operations. Beyond scale, 
there is also agreement that the SEJLS program will help establish stronger operation project 
design and impact evaluation standards in GPs, which improves the consistency of WBG jobs-
lending strategies. Additionally, the Jobs Group has held initial discussion on the project with the 
EU and the ILO.

Window 1 will also incorporate key IFC operations not part of the SEJLS pilot. In past years, 
IFC has strengthened the jobs focus of selected investment and advisory programs. Broadening 
the scope of this work can have tremendous benefits on leveraging the jobs potential of private 
sector investment.
Window 1 aims to establish and enforce technical standards for jobs-relevant projects to 
ensure a consistent, systematic, and intentional approach to jobs outcomes across GPs. 
This will produce a new generation of operations featuring improved design, consisting of three 
key elements: 
(i)	
Projects supported under Window 1 will incorporate the expected benefits on jobs outcomes 
in their underlining theory of change (ToC). The narrative of the project objectives should 
explain causal links between the operation’s activities, outputs, intermediate outcomes, and 
longer-term outcomes and the benefits expected to occur beyond project’s closing. The ToC 
should identify indicators to measure progress on achievement of outcomes. 
(ii)	 Projects will build on an economic analysis estimating return to public investment and 
analyzing the distribution of gains. This analysis will incorporate the following elements:
	›
Specify market failures the investment addresses. GPs typically address different market 
failures, such as capital market failures, coordination failures, natural monopolies in network 
services, externalities in education/training, among other things. The analysis should explain 
how the investment aims to correct market failures.
	›
Estimate social gains. The analysis should attempt to quantify projected earnings gains that 
might arise from job creation or productivity growth linked to the project’s implementation. 
Job creation, job quality, job access, and intermediate benefits such as human capital 
investments are relevant jobs outcomes. Income gains to workers represent a labor 
externality that should be included in the analysis.
	›
Specify distribution of expected gains. The analysis should also specify the types of 
workers who receive the social gains (segment of the labor force and their attributes).
	›
Identify jobs outcomes indicators. Projects will adopt them as part of their M&E framework. 
These will be key to monitor progress towards their stated jobs objectives. This will not only 
contribute to more effective jobs intervention, but also improve the quality and availability of 
operational data on jobs.
Window 1 will also inform specific project components or instruments with direct links 
to improving jobs outcomes in WBG operations. Across sectors and types of interventions, 
these activities will aim to maximize the potential benefits on jobs outcomes of associated WBG 
investments and to systematize related transmission channels. 
Window 2—Measurement 
This window will enable evidence-based jobs initiatives. Key objectives will be: (i) upgrade 
country-level data and diagnostics on jobs outcomes to enable evidence-based jobs initiatives, and 
(ii) advance the technical capacity for measurement of jobs outcomes to provide policymakers with 
improved information on the expected impact of their interventions.

Window 2 will continue support the jobs knowledge and measurement agenda to provide 
policymakers with the tools they need to enact effective jobs initiatives. In particular, Window 2 
will achieve this by (i) making more and better jobs outcomes data available, (ii) undertaking 
diagnostics to prioritize action on binding jobs challenges, and (iii) promoting reliable measurement 
of economy-wide jobs effects. 
Accurately identifying the key job challenges an economy faces is the foundation of effective 
jobs strategies. Countries typically face multiple jobs challenges at the same time and, depending 
on the context, these may have different causes and constitute more or less binding issues. 
Such complexity calls for country-focused evidence about core jobs problem(s) countries face, 
and what might be causing them. In this context, the importance of solid diagnostics building on 
economy‑wide and—where available—regional data on jobs outcomes through national data sources 
cannot be overstated.
To promote deeper country jobs analysis, the Jobs Group has developed standardized country 
and region-specific Jobs Diagnostics with the support of the Jobs MDTF. Jobs diagnostics 
apply standard tools and techniques and follow a data-driven guided enquiry that considers whether 
jobs outcomes in the country are within normal ranges given the country’s growth and economic 
transformation. Jobs Diagnostics interpret detailed information about the path of economic 
transformation in a country, the changing profile of workers and jobs over time, returns to education, 
and probabilities of labor force participation and employment. They identify abnormal symptoms by 
benchmarking the country’s jobs outcomes over time against other similar countries at similar stages 
of development. Jobs Diagnostics increasingly feed into WBG Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs), 
Country Economic Memoranda (CEMs), and Poverty Assessments.
Beyond data and diagnostics, Window 2 will contribute to better measuring the effects of 
public policies, programs, and private investments on jobs outcomes. Projects that target direct 
job creation—that is, where jobs creation is a direct result of the project’s implementation—do 
not pose particular estimation challenges. However, such projects represent a minority of Bank 
interventions; for most WBG projects, the number of jobs directly associated with an investment 
will be small relative to the indirect effects through backward and forward linkages, or the catalytic 
effects of investing in infrastructure, the financial sector, education/skills, regulatory reform, or other 
enabling sectors. For example, investing in energy infrastructure creates direct employment through 
temporary construction jobs (and possibly new permanent jobs in generation and distribution), but 
it will create considerably more jobs from indirect and induced demand for labor. But all of these 
could be dwarfed by the number of dynamically-induced jobs that result from the transformational 
change that energy access has on investment and growth, such as increased productivity and 
improved access to markets.
Window 2 will expand IFC’s Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring (AIMM) to 
selected WBG operations. This will build on the initial collaboration with the IFC under SEJLS to 
pilot their approach to indirect jobs estimation in the context of jobs-relevant WBG operations. In 
particular, IFC’s current estimation framework assesses IFC investment projects and would need 
to expansion to a broad enough base of potential WBG interventions.

Window 3—Influence through Partnerships & Innovation 
This window will support a strong engagement and dissemination outreach between the 
Jobs Group and key stakeholders. Key objectives will be: (i) influence non-WBG jobs strategies by 
convening key stakeholders to learn from MDTF outputs, and (ii) identify and accelerate cutting‑edge 
solutions to emerging jobs challenges and scaling them through WBG operations.
A key goal of Window 3 is to support partnerships between the private sector and WBG 
operations. This will build on the experience of the Let’s Work and S4YE partnerships under Phase I 
of the MDTF. It will link strongly to the work of the IFC investment and advisory services operations 
and the private sector development work of the WBG in general, including the Country Private 
Sector Diagnostics (CPSD) workstream, led jointly by the Finance, Competitiveness and Innovation 
(FCI) GP and the IFC.
Window 3 will leverage IFC’s experience in unlocking private investment as the primary 
financier of the private sector at the WBG. IFC’s focus on more, better, and inclusive jobs across 
sectors can lead to opportunities to innovate new pilot programs and expand or scale-up those 
that have already demonstrated jobs results on the ground. The IFC 3.0 Creating Markets strategy 
will further reinforce upstream, market creating activities that seek to rescue, rebuild, and recover 
markets, especially in the context of COVID-19. Numerous opportunities exist to strengthen linkages 
with the private sector on jobs-focused investments and advisory engagements.
Window 3 will establish an “Innovation Challenge”, which will identify and accelerate 
pioneering diagnosis and solutions to jobs challenges. The focus will be on solutions that have 
already established “proof of concept” and are ready to scale. This will help the World Bank crowd-in 
cutting-edge innovative ideas and take them to scale. This workstream will require a high external 
engagement and working with a wide variety of stakeholders and partners.
The windows proposed under the new structure of the Jobs MDTF are mutually reinforcing, 
building on existing synergies between them. By improving assessments of jobs effects prior to 
projects, Window 1 will provide new evidence from operational projects—especially leveraging WB 
and IFC operations with the private sector—that can inform measurement work under Window 2. 
Additionally, since most WBG lending operations occur in client countries where data are scarce, 
outdated, incomplete, or otherwise not accessible, assessments of jobs effects before projects 
could improve data access or create demand for better country capacity to generate high-quality, 
timely data to monitor progress and inform policy. 
Window 1 projects can also benefit from measurement developments under Window 2. 
This is especially true given the Jobs Group’s role in supporting proposal development and grant 
implementation, and the renewed collaboration among GPs and the IFC established through SEJLS, 
which Phase II will maintain. This will draw on a variety of credible approaches to measurement, 
including impact evaluation studies as well as modelling approaches based in Input-Output tables, 
Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs), and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) techniques, and 
the IFC AIMM framework.
Finally, strengthening our understanding of economy-wide impacts of jobs strategies and 
interventions, including through better development impact measurement and monitoring, is 
T H E  J O B S  M D T F  P H A S E  I I

a public good. All the windows will help spark discussion with key stakeholders globally and could 
support other partners’ efforts to develop standardized and effective ways to estimate jobs impacts.
The five existing Phase I MDTF windows will continue to function until committed funds fully 
disburse. Following that, these workstreams will be integrated within the new three‑window structure.
Theory of change
To reflect refinements, an updated TOC, monitored through a revised results framework, will 
shape the Jobs MDTF during Phase II. Having discussed the channels of continuity between the 
Phase I and Phase II workstreams of the Jobs MDTF, Phase II objectives and structures adjust to
the needs of the upcoming work program. Figure 2.2 captures the program’s updated TOC, linking 
main activities to expected outputs, intermediate outcomes, as well as development outcomes. The 
structure reflects the three windows among which the activities will be distributed.

**Image Description:**
The image shows a man wearing a light denim shirt, a yellow reflective safety vest with two gray horizontal reflective stripes, glasses, and a face mask pulled down slightly below his nose. He is standing on the side of a road, facing a person on a motorcycle. The man appears to be gesturing or signaling with both hands held up, palms facing outward.

The person on the motorcycle is wearing a helmet and casual clothing. There are several vehicles on the road, including a white car, a red van, and a bus further down the road. In the background, there are billboards with some visible text. One billboard reads "LA GASTRONOMIE PIZZA" and shows a price "247000F" along with an image of a woman holding food. Another sign says "GASY PUB."

The setting appears to be a busy urban street with some greenery along the sidewalk. The image conveys a scene of traffic management or street interaction, possibly related to safety or urban development efforts.

There is no other visible text relevant to the report on the man’s vest or in the immediate foreground. The overall atmosphere suggests involvement in a community or city development project.

HIGHLIGHTS OF ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS
JOIN GLOBAL JOBS INDICATOR DATABASE 
Jobs are crucial for development, so a jobs-inclusive database was needed to support the 
design of public policies.5 JOIN is a Global Jobs Indicator Data Bank—a standardized repository 
of key labor market indicators—for WB staff and policymakers. The WB Jobs Group launched JOIN 
in 2019 and updated it in 2020. After the latest update, the current version of JOIN uses 2,185 
surveys totaling about 228 million observations. The surveys are drawn from a dedicated and 
standardized World Bank survey compilation focusing on labor indicators, called the International 
Income Distribution Data Set (I2D2). The surveys from 164 countries, of which 74 percent are low 
and middle-income countries. All household surveys have a labor module with about every fourth 
survey being a labor force survey (LFS) (27.3 percent). To ensure reliability, all surveys are subject to a 
data quality check. After filtering out surveys that do not pass the check, the published JOIN covers 
1,430 surveys in 162 countries. JOIN currently provides 105 standardized labor market indicators 
derived from household surveys, representing the most common indicators used for World Bank’s 
jobs diagnostics. 
Additionally, in 2020 the team launched a new Microsoft Excel-based JOIN benchmarking tool 
to give users more options to customize analysis. The tool, based on disaggregated JOIN data, 
allows users to choose the country they want to analyze, the timeline, and survey types. Several 
predefined “pivot” tables facilitate tabulations of different subgroups, such as gender, urban/rural, 
age groups, employment status, employment types, sectors, occupations, and education level. The 
tool enables not only the display of indicators for subgroups but also the interaction between these 
subgroup-level indicators. To further customize analysis, users can easily modify the pivot tables and 
their design. They can, for example, add or change subgroups, ranging from urban versus rural to 
education level by gender. The JOIN benchmarking tool points users to the Jobs Diagnostic-guided 
inquiry if they want to conduct a standardized jobs diagnostic. Additionally, users can modify standard 
outputs from the guided enquiry and compare their chosen country against up to 10 other countries. 
SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE JOBS LENDING AT SCALE (SEJLS)
The MDTF launched the SEJLS program in July 2019, following consultations with the Jobs 
MDTF donor partners and the JSC. SEJLS better defines and measures outcomes and benefits 
from jobs-relevant policies and programs; as such, it focuses on leveraging large-scale WBG lending 
operations, and improving design consistency of their jobs-relevant components and estimation of 
jobs outcomes. SEJLS implemented between July, 2019 and June, 2021 will use the available Jobs 
MDTF funding balance of just over US$ 5 million. 
5	 World Development Report 2012 and the SDGs both reference the importance of more, good quality jobs.

## Page 41
The first round of SEJLS incorporates fifteen “champion projects” representing strategic 
and jobs-relevant WBG business lines. The JSC selected the projects based on advice from the 
Jobs Technical Working Group (TWG)—composed of senior GP and IFC staff members. The SEJLS 
champion project relied on two criteria: they map to strategic operational areas where the WBG will 
increase its future portfolio focus, and they have high potential to address jobs challenges.
To build comprehensive operational knowledge, SEJLS supports operations using different 
WBG lending instruments. The WBG employs a range of different lending instruments, depending 
on appropriateness for development objectives. Most SEJLS champion projects employ Investment 
Project Financing (IPF). Two operations supported employ Program for Results (P4R) financing—
which use a country’s own institutions and processes and link WB fun disbursement to achievement 
of specific program results. Finally, one SELJLS-supported project is a Development Policy Lending 
(DPL) instrument, which supports policy and institutional actions.
The SEJLS portfolio reflects the cross-cutting nature of jobs and their multi-sectoral aspects. 
The champion projects range across six WBG GPs and two Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas (CCSAs)—
namely Gender and Fragility and Conflict and Violence (FCV).
FIGURE 3.1
Geographical Distribution of Projects Supported by SEJLS
The selected projects cover five WBG lending regions. Most (nine) explore jobs-related project 
components of lending operations in African, European, and Central Asian countries. In terms of 
lending quotas in associated projects, projects in African and South Asian countries make up the 
largest share (63 percent). Annex C presents progress on SEJLS at the grant level covering the 15 
champion projects. Some common trends across projects over the calendar year 2020 include:

The SEJLS pilot aims to validate an approach to improve the WBF jobs line of work, focusing 
on leveraging the relevant WBG portfolio. In particular, SEJLS aims to shift the operational 
approach to jobs towards a more comprehensive definition of jobs outcomes and a broader analytical 
framework to estimate its effects. 
The most direct SEJLS benefit is to influence jobs-relevant initiatives across the WBG and 
hold them to higher standards. This can be measured by how many projects adhere to the higher 
technical standards elaborated by the Jobs Group and by the results of the increased analytical 
scrutiny.
In line with SEJLS objectives, supported activities include jobs-relevant components within 
existing or planned operational engagements. Across sectors and types of interventions, SEJLS 
supports activities aiming to maximize jobs outcome benefits of the associated WBG investments.

These include optimizing project component/instrument design and improved economic analysis 
and monitoring and evaluation. For mature projects, this includes adapting project design to 
support additional financing, and incorporation of pilots to explore validity of new jobs-relevant 
project components.
The COVID-19 crisis occurred soon after the team had finalized SEJLS project proposals. This 
hindered WBG operational teams from implementing several agreed activities. Restrictions on travel 
and movement and prioritization of emergency response interventions caused major obstacles in 
implementing SEJLS support activities.
As a consequence, while most of these jobs activities are experiencing delays, their relevance 
has increased. Beyond common delays, the large majority of the activities planned to support SEJLS 
champion projects have not been revised after COVID-19. In fact, the evolving crisis has increased 
pressure across sectors to respond to the dramatic pandemic labor market crisis. Being designed to 
support operations to maximize jobs outcomes, SEJLS activities are a priority for COVID‑19 recovery.
SOLUTIONS FOR YOUTH EMPLOYMENT (S4YE)
This year the team further scaled-up S4YE activities across all pillars of the work program, 
despite COVID-19 challenges. The following represents a summarized update on all aspects of 
the S4YE work program.
As planned, the S4YE’s Board met twice last year in May 2020 and November 2020. The 
May 2020 meeting also facilitated a change of the Board Chair from the Rockefeller Foundation to 
Microsoft on completion of the two-year tenure. The SPJ Global Director, who represents the World 
Bank on the S4YE Board/Steering Committee, nominated Microsoft as incoming Board chair. In 
addition, the team also facilitated bilateral consultations between the new Chair Naria Santa Lucia 
of Microsoft and each member of the S4YE Board to seek feedback on strategic priorities.
S4YE created and launched a Knowledge Repository for Youth Employment Practitioners 
last year, which hosts tools developed by the World Bank and by S4YE partners. This online, 
live, searchable database of tools, guidance notes, and reports represents a global public good for 
any youth employment practitioner. This year the team further updated the Repository and added 
70 new practitioner tools/toolkits. The Repository now has over 300 tools/resources for youth 
employment practitioners. The team also created four new categories under the Repository: Youth 
with Disabilities, Digital Economy, Green Economy, and Agriculture.
The team led creation of two thematic reports and two MDTF Solution Notes:
•	 Jobs in the Orange Economy, which highlights opportunities in creative sectors for youth 
employment. This Note, was authored in partnership with the Digital Development GP, the 
S4YE Impact Portfolio partners, the Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator, and the Pakistan 
Poverty Alleviation Fund
•	 Digital Jobs for Youth Disabilities was developed in partnership with internal and external 
partners through a small Working Group, including the World Bank’s Social Inclusion GP (Global 
Disability Advisor team) and the Social Protection GP. The Group also included S4YE partners 
the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), the United States Agency for

The team published three Knowledge Briefs: 
•	 Knowledge Brief 10—How are Youth Employment programs adapting to COVID-19? 
(in  partnership with Impact Portfolio partners IYF, Harambee, RBK, and Youth Business 
International etc.) This Note curated new, just-in-time changes to youth programs and their 
delivery models in response to COVID‑19. 
•	 Knowledge Brief 11—How Technology Can Help Incorporate Youth Voice In Employment 
Programs? (in partnership with Educate! and Africa’s Voices Foundation). This Note outlined 
practical ways that youth employment programs can use technology to incorporate youth voice 
in program design.
•	 Knowledge Brief 12—How private sector companies are supporting youth employment during 
COVID? (in partnership with S4YE private sector partners Coursera, Facebook, Microsoft, Visa, 
Avasant Foundation, Accenture, and others). This Note curated all ongoing private company 
efforts—especially those in the S4YE partner network—to support youth employment 
during COVID‑19.
S4YE launched a new “How to” series to provide a quick step-by-step guide in 1–2 pages 
for practitioners and policymakers designing new youth employment programs. The team 
published two “How to” Notes in 2020 in partnership with the World bank’s Mexico Youth Labor 
Market Inclusion (MYLMI) project:
•	 “How to” Note Issue 1—How To Include Youth Voice In Youth Employment Programs?
•	 “How to” Note Issue 2—How To Design An SMS Outreach Strategy In Youth Employment 
Programs? 
The team partnered with World Bank’s Youth-2-Youth (Y2Y) team to organize the following 
knowledge sharing sessions: 
•	 Presentation for S4YE “Integrating Youth Voice In Program Design” Webinar (November 2020).
•	 Presentation for S4YE-Y2Y joint webinar on “Making remote work accessible for Ukraine’s 
vulnerable youth in the COVID era via online training” (October 2020).
•	 Presentation for S4YE-Y2Y joint webinar on “The Power of Youth Communities in Scaling Up 
Skills Innovation” (October 2020).
•	 Presentation for the S4YE-Y2Y joint webinar on “How do we engage young people in the 
agriculture sector to build more sustainable and resilient global food systems post-COVID-19?” 
(September 2020).
The S4YE team continued to build and deepen partnerships. S4YE launched a very successful 
series of monthly webinars highlighting the work of a private sector partner each month, in an effort 
to strengthen partnership with the private sector and bring insights and lessons to WBG teams. 
Over 150–220 participants joined each webinar with several follow up emails helped establish

new dialogue and partnerships between private sector and WBG teams. Annex G details the eight 
monthly webinars.
Impact Portfolio Community of Practice: The S4YE team continued to strengthen its work 
with its community of practice (CoP). The team conducted an end of FY survey (June 2020) 
with its Impact Portfolio partners to seek feedback on strategic priorities and collaborate on work 
planning. The team also scheduled a series of meetings immediately after the COVID‑19 outbreak 
to collect insights on how IP projects were changing content and work delivery with youth to adapt 
to COVID‑19. The consultations resulted in a practical Note on specific ways to adapt to COVID‑19. 
S4YE teamed with other organizations to support their workshops and events and share 
lessons, including:
•	 Nestle Alliance Annual Summit (December 2020).
•	 International Outsourcing Professional Annual Forum (November 2020).
•	 Local Economic Development Series: “How can we Support the Employment of Vulnerable 
Youth During and After COVID-19 Webinar?” (October 2020).
•	 3rd Annual IZA / World Bank / NJD / UNU-WIDER Jobs and Development Conference: Better 
Jobs for Development (September 2020).
The S4YE team strengthened its support role to internal WBG teams, supporting different 
GPs and the IFC and providing technical advice and suggestions to various TTLs. For details 
see Annex G.
ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS FROM ONGOING JOBS MDTF GRANTS
This section provides a progress update on activities and results from ongoing grants over 
calendar year 2020. 
The Jobs Group continued its engagement in Mozambique through the Let’s Work Partnership 
Country Pilot (Grant Amount US$ 4.6 million). A Jobs Strategy Note summarized recent 
Bank analytical work on Mozambique and integrated the most important policy and program 
recommendations for accelerating jobs transformation stemming from the Let’s Work program’s 
activities in Mozambique. The team also advanced the following four activities that it will complete 
by the grant closure date (May 2021): 
(i)	
More and Better Jobs from Crops and Trees in Mozambique. The focus of this value chain 
study is to identify entry points and policy implications for creation of more and better jobs 
through three agricultural value chains: cassava, cashew, and plantation forestry. It aims to help 
inform ongoing debates in Mozambique on how agriculture and natural resource management 
can contribute to rural jobs transformation. 
(ii)	 Mozambique Agriculture Aggregator Pilot Study (MAAP). The final report presents the 
findings of a three-year evaluation of aggregator schemes in Mozambique, and seeks to 
understand the factors behind the success of some anchor firms’ and in terms of farmer 
profitability. The key motivating idea of the study is that poor contract growers may benefit 
from aggregator firms’ expansions, but initial firm returns may be low. This calls for an

integrated approach to understand aggregator systems growers and at commercial firms. 
Farmer income gains represent a “jobs-linked externality,” which might justify using public 
resources to support firm expansions. 
(iii)	 Biscate: Biscate is a private labor market matching platform connecting informal service 
workers with clients through a hybrid technology (internet-based for clients and Unstructured 
Supplementary Service Data (USSD)-based for workers without smartphones). Such platforms 
can help overcome labor market “information asymmetries” and help workers access better jobs. 
A Let’s Work Partnership evaluation of the platform aimed to quantify service provider earnings 
benefits as well as the increase in demand for such services. The final report will integrate 
lessons learned from deployment of the platform and considerations on its effectiveness.
(iv)	 Enterprise Survey of firms’ jobs growth potential and COVID-19 effects on firms and jobs: 
in collaboration with the World Bank Enterprise Survey team, this study—which will inform 
component 2 of the World Bank Demographic Dividend Project in Mozambique—was originally 
designed to support employment creation through a Business Plan Competition (BPC) and 
inform the design of activities of the Mozambique Let’s Work partners in the area of youth 
employment and private sector development. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
team has also carried out a pulse survey on COVID-19 effects on the private sector, and on 
what short-term assistance measures firms prefer. This has been done in collaboration with 
the World Bank Enterprise Survey team.
(v)	 Improving Jobs of Smallholder Women Farmers grant in Mozambique (Grant Amount 
US$ 0.3 million). This grant funds the design and implementation of two training interventions 
for female farmers as part of a World Bank feeder road rehabilitation operation in Tete province, 
Mozambique. Benefits from these interventions are being evaluated using a rigorous 
Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) approach including 2,240 women in 112 villages located 
along three feeder roads in Angonia, Macanga, and Tsangano districts. The WB-funded project 
selected two of the roads for rehabilitation. The team analyzed data to measure benefits of 
the two training interventions, showing that Personal Initiative (“soft skills”) training fostered 
entrepreneurship outside the farm, doubling the share of women running profitable off-farm 
businesses and generating an important additional source of household income. The team also 
found that Personal Initiative training enhances the effectiveness of agricultural extension (“hard 
skills”), leading to large increases in area cultivated and adoption of fertilizers, pesticides, good 
farming practices (such crop rotation and mulching), and cash crops (including soy), generating 
greater overall value of harvest sold. Further, the team found that that household expenditure 
increased in the target group, with results persisting after the interventions left the field. The 
team is currently drafting a policy brief and an academic paper to disseminate results.
In Liberia, the Youth Opportunities Impact Evaluation (IE) Grant (Grant Amount US$ 0.35 million) 
addresses key questions on how to cost-effectively promote self-employment and entrepreneurship 
in fragile and conflict-affected states (FCS). The IE centers around the Government of Liberia’s 
Small Business Support (SBS) (formerly known as Household Enterprise Support) component of the 
Youth Opportunities Program (YOP). The study assesses return on investment to integrating skills 
training with start-up grants versus provision of start-up grants alone to youth business groups. the 
IE design randomly assigned eligible youth to different interventions under SBS. The IE tests the

hypothesis that youth in Liberia are capital-constrained, which limits their ability to effectively pursue 
self-employment and entrepreneurship. Preliminary results indicate that self-employment increased 
for treatment group beneficiaries, while their financial inclusion and ownership of business assets 
also increased compared to the control group. 
In Nepal, the Jobs Platform (Grant Amount US$ 0.5 million) supports better jobs outcomes in 
Nepal’s formal and informal sector, especially for low-income workers and excluded groups. There 
are two main outcomes of this multi-pronged effort:
(i)	
Publication of a comprehensive diagnostic of Nepal’s jobs challenges with implications for 
future job creation and quality, and a set of integrated strategic policy interventions to address 
labor demand and supply challenges. In 2020, the team published the SME study “Market 
Study to Understand Job Growth Potential in SMEs in Nepal”, central to the labor demand 
analysis in the Jobs Diagnostic. The SME study findings, disseminated through a validation 
workshop in July 2019 with Government officials, partners, commercial banks, investors, 
business support organizations and members of civil society, reflected the range of actors in 
the SME ecosystem. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Jobs Diagnostic report dissemination 
took place through virtual sessions with the Government and development partners, as well 
as internally within the World Bank through a joint webinar organized with the Gender Group. 
(ii)	  Improved alignment of the Nepal lending portfolio with jobs objectives. This was achieved 
through assessment of the current WB portfolio mapping against the three-pillar Jobs 
Conceptual Framework (JCF) for monitoring jobs impacts (more, better, and more inclusive 
jobs). This assessment identified support gaps at the project and portfolio levels when 
considered against national priorities. The team also developed a new portfolio monitoring 
system—the Jobs Impact Measurement tool (JIM): a user-friendly matrix for the CMU to track 
WB project current and future projects designed to explicitly mitigate key jobs challenges. The 
JIM tool incorporates jobs-specific measurement indicators to help TTLs track impacts and lay 
the groundwork for future jobs-focused project components. A CMU can easily update the 
tool, disseminated to and validated by TTLs, to reflect country team discussions and evolving 
jobs-related objectives.
In Mexico, the Youth Labor Market Inclusion grant (Grant Amount US$ 2.0 million) is 
designing, piloting, and evaluating innovative approaches to improve employment outcomes 
for low-income youth graduating from upper secondary education and transitioning into the 
labor market. The project engages targeted youth before entering the labor market and offers them 
a package of interventions to guide study and work decisions, strengthen job search skills, and 
connect graduates with quality employment opportunities in strategic, productive sectors. Targeted 
low-income youth include former beneficiaries of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs. In 2020, 
trained staff delivered a labor market literacy workshop at upper secondary schools as part of the 
project. At the end of the workshop, a randomly selected sample of 970 youths from the total 1,924 
received an offer to obtain a FEI if able to prove permanence in formal employment after graduation. 
Early evaluation show that FEI increases the short-term probability of being formally employed and 
a increases job stability in the formal labor market. The team also found that the increase in job 
experience associated with the FEI increases workers’ salaries. Emerging findings suggest that 
formal jobs may have also have helped protect youth from COVID-19 crisis effects.

UNDERSTANDING AND RESPONDING TO COVID-19
COVID-19 has caused not only a global health crisis but also an economic and jobs crisis. Due 
to illness and health concerns, travel bans, quarantine measures, and other mobility constraints, 
many workers cannot work. Those that do work experience productivity—and often incomes—
decreases. Global and local supply chain disruption have decreased labor demand, and businesses 
closed or remain open only limited hours across many countries. Even when operating, lower 
consumer demand affects earnings.
Labor market prospects worsened rapidly due to COVID-19 effects on labor supply and 
demand. Many people have become vulnerable to reduced income, furloughs, or layoffs from the 
crisis, and millions of jobs could be lost permanently. ILO projections suggest that labor market 
recovery during the second half of 2020 will be incomplete, with unemployment expected to rise by 
between 140 million and 340 million—per the most pessimistic scenario, which assumes a second 
wave of the pandemic. Even in the most optimistic scenario, which assumes a fast recovery, global 
working hours are unlikely to return to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2020.
While there was already a significant demand in WBG countries for support on jobs programs, 
COVID‑19 has cast a sharp light on the importance of implementing effective jobs strategies. 
Improving our understanding of jobs outcomes and of what programs deliver benefits on the ground 
remains a priority. This huge COVID-19 crisis might represent an opportunity to address some 
obstacles to better jobs outcomes that existed pre-COVID‑19. The extent of employment effects 
from the pandemic depends on policy responses, and countries risk severe and long-lasting effects 
if policies are not timely or effective. 
At the same time, pandemic disruptions and the speed with which the crisis has unfolded 
have created new measurement challenges. Methods and sources normally used to track labor 
market outcomes may have significant shortcomings. Furthermore, social distancing and other 
transmission prevention measures have affected several data-related activities around the world, 
potentially limiting data availability, quality, and reliability.
The massive COVID‑19 labor market disruptions affect all categories of workers, but 
some groups have been particularly negatively affected. Women workers have suffered 
disproportionally, particularly due to the service sector downturn. Women also account for a large 
proportion of workers in front-line occupations, especially in the health and social care sectors where 
they represent 70 percent of workforce. Finally, closures of early childhood education centers, 
care services, and schools, along with the unavailability of older relatives to provide support, have 
exacerbated lack of childcare. Care services are not only key for job creation, they also sustain 
workforce participation by providing critical support to workers. Young people are also critically 
affected by the COVID-19 crisis. A total of 178 million young workers around the world—more than 
four in ten employed young people globally—worked in hard-hit sectors when the crisis began. 
Both technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and on-the-job training have suffered 
massive disruptions.
Jobs MDTF initiatives represent an important part of the WBG’s COVID-19 response strategy, 
both in emergency and recovery phases. SEJLS champion projects have experienced some 
delays in the first stage of the pandemic, but have quickly progressed since to respond to dramatic

## Page 49
client labor market disruptions. Across the SEJLS portfolio, activities that involve data collection are 
considering adding specific modules on COVID-19 to deepen the understanding of the impact of the 
pandemic on beneficiaries targeted by the projects. SEJLS projects are very important strategically 
in terms of their potential to generate positive jobs outcomes. For example:
•	 In Cambodia, SEJLS supports the severely disrupted tourism sector by promoting nature-based 
tourism activities to attract visitors while reducing pressure on natural resources. 
•	 In Bangladesh, SEJLS supports an operation promoting private investment and job creation in 
economic zones and digital entrepreneurship in hi-tech parks. Support focuses on estimating 
expected jobs and earnings benefit (direct, indirect, and induced job creation) over a five and 
a ten-year period from investment, contributing to maximize employment creation during 
COVID‑19 recovery.
•	 In Ghana, SEJLS funds contribute to strengthen the design and implementation of skills 
development programs, aiming to maximize the project’s effects on job creation. 
The new JobsWatch initiative addresses key questions on the effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic on developing countries’ labor markets.6 High-frequency phone survey (HFPS) 
collected data to estimate crisis’ labor markets disruptions in 39 countries. Data obtained between 
April and July 2020 showed that workers in these countries experienced severe labor market 
disruptions following the outbreak. 
COVID-19 “JOBSWATCH” 
The JobsWatch initiative helps inform labor market policy responses during the evolving 
crisis to prepare for recovery. The development objective of this activity is to synthesize and 
generate new evidence on COVID-19 labor market effects on workers, households, and firms, and 
to track economic policy responses. The Jobs group in the Social Protection and Jobs GP and the 
Data for Goals group in the Poverty and Equity GP co-led the JobsWatch initiative to address four 
key questions for as much of the developing world as possible: 
•	 What are the labor market disruptions of the crisis on workers, households, and firms, and how 
do these vary across countries and over time?
•	 Which types of workers and jobs have been most negatively affected by the crisis? What does 
this imply for distributional labor market effects?
•	 What were the policy responses to the crisis and how do they correlate with the magnitude of 
the labor market disruptions at different phases of the crisis?
•	 How does the COVID-19 crisis affect the medium-term policy agenda to promote economic 
transformation and better jobs for more people?
JobsWatch collaborated with related activities of two key Bank teams. The first was the team 
led by the Poverty and Equity GP in collaboration with DEC and the Finance, Competitiveness and 
Innovation (FCI) GP on collecting and harmonizing HFPS monitoring data from households and/or 
firms in over 100 countries. While the Poverty & Equity GP provides dashboards and reports with

general summary statistics from the phone surveys, the “JobsWatch” initiative will complement 
them with more in-depth analysis on labor market outcomes. The second key Bank team in the 
Social Protection and Jobs GP is collects information on social protection policy responses to the 
crisis from a variety of country focal points and other international organizations. 
JobsWatch will complement and extend the efforts of partner international organizations to 
monitor labor market responses to the crisis. The ILO also monitors labor market conditions and 
releases regular updates of its Global Employment Trends. Similarly, the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and IMF also analyze labor market trends, building upon 
ILO information. JobsWatch will complement these efforts through monitoring employment trends 
in five important ways:
(i)	
Based on the Bank High-Frequency Monitoring phone survey, conducted in coordination with 
national statistics offices, which will contribute new household survey data to the effort.
(ii)	 Focus on developing countries, unlike the OECD.
(iii)	 	Compares outcomes across selected countries, in addition to regional monitoring. This is 
important because lessons from the 2008 financial crisis indicate that economic shock effects 
vary widely across different countries in the same region. Understanding this can provide 
insights into transmission mechanisms, countries that suffered most, and policies that mitigate 
crisis effects.
(iv)	 Describes detailed data sources and methodologies used to measure crisis effects.
(v)	 Explores how the crisis affects vulnerable workers, such as the poor, young, and lower-skilled. 
To the extent possible, it will exploit longitudinal data to document effects on different types 
of workers across crisis stages. 
(vi)	 Investigates how the “new normal” will permanently shift the policy agenda to promote Jobs 
and economic transformation in developing countries.
Early JobsWatch findings suggest that 34 percent of respondents reported stopping work, 20 
percent of wage workers reported lack of payment for work performed, 9 percent reported job 
changes due to the pandemic, and 62 percent reported household income loss. Twenty-two 
percent of agricultural workers reported stopping work, as opposed to 40 percent for industry and 
38 percent for services. This suggests that disruptions to labor markets were substantial. In addition 
to stopping work, pay reductions due to decreased economic activity represented an important 
challenge. Many workers kept their jobs but were not receiving full payment for work performed, 
possibly due to furlough or employers delaying or reducing pay.
HFPS estimates of work stoppage and income loss are generally consistent with reductions 
in gross domestic products (GDP) projections in Latin America and the Caribbean, but not in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, indicating that phone survey data contributes valuable new information 
about crisis effects. Ensuring future availability of such critical data requires investments in 
statistical and physical infrastructure as well as human capital to set up Emergency Observatories, 
which can rapidly deploy phone surveys to inform decision makers.

In response to the pandemic, S4YE stepped up its role of facilitating catalytic action and 
collective learning between World Bank teams, the private sector, and portfolio partners. 
In particular, the S4YE team has been facilitating just-in-time learning through organizing peer-
to-peer learning sessions and publishing short practical knowledge briefs on practical solutions. 
Early after the pandemic hit, the S4YE team connected with all its Impact Portfolio (IP) project 
partners to understand how these youth employment programs were dealing with COVID‑19 and 
how they would ensure continued youth support. Drawing on practical solutions curated from these 
discussions, S4YE published a Knowledge Brief “How are youth employment programs adapting 
to COVID” to highlight innovative ways youth employment projects adapted curriculum, services, 
and delivery models.

Overall S4YE team identified six main strategies that youth employment programs were 
using to maintain operational and programmatic continuity: (i) scaling virtual operations, (ii) 
crowdsourcing ideas from youth, (iii) accelerating remote learning, (iv) encouraging youth voice, 
(v) increasing support for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and(vi) leveraging new 
growth opportunities. 
One of the four pillars of S4YE’s ecosystem is a network of private sector companies 
committed to addressing youth employment challenges. Through S4YE’s Private Sector Advisory 
Council (PSAC), private sector partners learn, showcase, and support scaling innovative youth 
employment interventions. Since the pandemic, several S4YE partner companies have taken several 
rapid measures, launched new initiatives, or modified existing youth support programs. The S4YE 
curated and shared these efforts in a new Knowledge Brief, “How S4YE’s private sector partners 
supported youth employment in COVID.” Efforts included: (i) Support for Digital Skill Building, Online 
Learning/Training and Employment for Youth, (ii) Support to Build Resilience among MSMEs, (iii) 
Support for Youth Focused NGOs, (iv) Immediate Emergency Support to Public Authorities, and (v) 
Internal Measures to Ensure Business Continuity within the Organizations.
The S4YE team also hosted monthly online, peer-to-peer learning sessions with dedicated 
sessions on digital skills. These included Implementing an online learning platform (Facebook 
& Coursera); Scaling workforce development during COVID (IFC & Coursera); Teaching practical 
skills online (Commonwealth of Learning); and support for young entrepreneurs through, for 
example, Supporting Women-Owned Small Businesses (Facebook & Association for Enterprise 
Opportunity); Rapid Response to support youth entrepreneurs (Youth Business International, Google, 
and Accenture).
Finally, S4YE launched the Youth Advisory Group (YAG) COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Blog series. 
The series highlighted COVID-19 pandemic effects on young people and discussed YAG member 
local approaches to the crisis. The blogs focused on youth-developed solutions to address the food 
crisis, workforce training, health care, and harnessing social media.
NEXT STEPS
Initiate Jobs MDTF’s Phase II implementation for 2021 to 2025. Responding to IDA donors 
and government goals, during its second phase, the MDTF will focus on supporting large-scale 
operationalization of the jobs agenda, while continuing to support an innovative work program to 
address knowledge gaps. 
Continue SEJLS program implementation and invest in understanding jobs outcomes 
through data and analytics. The MDTF will continue to strengthen the design consistency of 
jobs-relevant project components and estimation of jobs outcomes. Targeted jobs indicators will 
vary across project types, but could include direct, indirect, and induced effects on the quantity 
and quality of jobs, and indicators on the characteristics of beneficiaries, such as males/females 
disaggregated by age, education, location, ethnicity/race, disability, and other relevant characteristics. 
Similarly, the MDTF will continue to support the measurement agenda. Improving understanding 
of jobs outcomes from WBG interventions is a high priority for the WBG, its shareholders, and 
H I G H L I G H T S  O F  A C T I V I T I E S  A N D  R E S U L T S
45


## Page 54
other stakeholders. Equally important is to disaggregate jobs reporting by gender and by other key 
dimensions, such as age, income, location, ethnicity, and disability.
Promote exchange of best practices and lessons from MDTF outputs and tools to help 
build development partners’ capacity. Beyond the WBG, it is crucial to reinforce the broader 
discussion on improving jobs outcomes with development partners as well as government and 
private sector actors. An important Jobs Group and Jobs MDTF role is to support dialogue between 
government agencies charged with addressing the jobs agenda—such as job creation commissions, 
competitiveness councils, and national training agencies—and leverage private sector involvement 
to identify opportunities for, and constraints to, accelerated job creation. During Phase I of the 
MDTF, the Let’s Work program supported advances on the jobs agenda in pilot countries such as 
Bangladesh, Mozambique, Tunisia, and Paraguay. During Phase II, the MDTF will ramp up its work 
with governments, private sector actors, and development partners to promote private sector-led 
jobs growth.
Maximize linkages to the JET theme, focusing on the poorest countries. Consensus is growing 
that accelerating economic transformation is the only way to create more and better jobs in a 
sustainable way and at scale. Successful transformation means responding to evolving technology 
and skills demand while taking account of economies’ resource endowments and comparative 
advantages. To increase production, firms need to invest in capital and technology. To raise labor 
productivity, workers must move towards jobs and sectors with higher value-added.7 This requires 
macroeconomic stability with low, stable inflation to help firms identify and respond to price signals. 
Open trade regimes; a competitive business environment; a flexible labor market; good quality, 
market-relevant education and training programs; better infrastructure; and an investment‑friendly 
business climate all help to facilitate job-creating private investment and allow workers and 
entrepreneurs to increase earnings. This broad agenda is at the core of the JET Special Theme 
incorporated under IDA 18, and further reinforced in IDA19. The Jobs MDTF will play a key role in 
supporting JET operationalization during Phase II by improving conceptual framing of a growing 
pipeline of WBG projects addressing jobs. It will also support improved measurement by contributing 
to efforts to better estimate indirect jobs effects from WBG operations.
Develop a community of practice (COP) of jobs-focused government agencies. Several 
client country government units have expressed interest in participating in S4YE’s innovation and 
practitioner-oriented learning community. This new COP responds to that demand by promoting 
informal exchange of practices and practical lessons between countries. This learning platform will 
facilitate and promote knowledge exchange on youth employment and broader jobs challenges and 
solutions to improve state capacity to address challenges. 
Build an agile public-private initiative on digital jobs in response to COVID-19. In collaboration 
with the Digital Development GP and S4YE’s private sector partners, this work will include promoting 
online work and digital public works, building digital capacity of S4YE/NGO partners, and developing 
a jobs agenda around broadband connectivity.

 Reallocation of resources to most productive uses may result in efficiency gains due to better use of resources or 
firms’ choices in their mix of factors of production. The latter may also affect capital and labor intensity of activities.

Advance the “Jobs-After-COVID” workstream. Building on lessons learned through the JobsWatch 
initiative and other fund activities mobilized in response to COVID-19, the Jobs Umbrella MDTF 
will continue focusing on medium-term prospects for accelerating jobs transitions in developing 
countries in the aftermath of the pandemic. This workstream will build on the recently launched 
Jobs-After-COVID call for proposals, which aims to identify and accelerate pioneering diagnosis 
of, and solutions to, post-pandemic jobs challenges. Work in this area also includes leveraging 
learning from the current pandemic, such as analyzing effects from policy responses, with a view 
to improving resilience against future crises.

- The man on the left is dressed in a black jacket with white stripes on the sleeves, blue jeans, and colorful sneakers. He is wearing a blue face mask and is looking down at the ground or the chickens.
- The man on the right is wearing a white polo shirt, brown pants, a brown belt, a gray baseball cap, and a light blue face mask. He is holding a mobile phone to his ear and looking in the direction of the other man.

Several chickens, mostly brown with red combs, are gathered around the men's feet, indicating this might be a small-scale poultry operation.

The background shows a corrugated metal wall, wooden beams, and some makeshift elements like a piece of cloth hanging and a wheelbarrow, which contribute to the informal, farm-like environment.

There is no visible text in the image. The composition and setting suggest a moment of inspection, consultation, or discussion related to poultry farming, which aligns with the context of an annual development report.

Note: For the purpose of lending the World Bank classifies economies into two categories (1) IDA countries and (2) IBRD countries 
based on their Gross National Income (GNI) and creditworthiness. Low-income and poor countries eligible for subsidized funding 
are provided loans and grants through International Development Association (IDA) and middle and high-income countries are given 
loans through International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Few countries are eligible to receive assistance from 
both the IDA and IBRD and are classified as Blend countries. World Bank also lends to countries with whom it doesn’t have an 
agreement through special financing products. In the chart above special financing refers to grant given to a West Bank and Gaza 
study—TF0A2341—Finance for Jobs in Palestine: Jobs Measurement and Methodologies (CGE and SCBA).

ANNEX B: 
BENEFICIARIES REACHED BY WBG JOBS PROGRAMS
BOX B.1 
BENEFICIARIES REACHED BY WBG JOBS PROGRAMS
The Jobs Group estimates the beneficiaries of jobs interventions at three levels*: 
(i)	
Direct beneficiaries of MDTF grants: Some MDTF-funded activities (such as pilots and IEs, 
among others) reach beneficiaries directly. This is reported by grant recipients in the results 
framework and stands at 41,182 beneficiaries, according to the latest estimates. 
(ii)	 Leveraged Portfolio Level: 43 Jobs MDTF Phase I grants are associated with 58 World Bank 
lending operations, valued at $7.74 billion. Of these, 22 projects track the number of direct 
project beneficiaries, which amounted to 6.9 million cumulatively per the latest estimate. 
Additionally, SEJLS grants are associated with 15 lending operations expected to reach 
2.4 million cumulative beneficiaries. 
(iii)	 Corporate Level: The corporate results indicator “beneficiaries of jobs-focused interventions” 
estimates the number of beneficiaries reached by jobs-relevant interventions in WBG‑supported 
operations, on the basis of data reported by the projects. In FY 2020, 238 jobs lending projects 
supported 14.5 million jobs, including 9.9 million in IDA countries, 3.1 million in IBRD countries, 
and 6.1 million female beneficiaries.
Note: *Includes people benefiting from innovative, scalable pilot programs (enhanced skills, reduced job search time, entry into 
self-employment, increase in income and/or earnings, improved quality of employment, greater productivity); and beneficiaries 
reached by jobs-focused WBG interventions supported by the MDTF, including both individuals and government agencies as well as 
private sector.

PROJECT-LEVEL UPDATES ON SEJLS ACTIVITIES
AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
BANGLADESH
LIVESTOCK AND DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
P161246
Development objective
To improve productivity, market access, and resilience of small‐holder farmers and agro‐entrepreneurs 
operating in selected livestock value chains in target areas.
Grant Activity 1
Activity I—A framework for job measurement in livestock operations: The team will prepare 
a technical note on the jobs measurement framework that will outline an underlying methodology 
to measure direct, indirect, and induced jobs outcomes of investment operations in the livestock 
sector. The note will outline an approach to measure jobs outcome in three different dimensions: 
i) Job Creation—outcomes related to the creation of more jobs for project beneficiaries along 
the value-chains; ii) Job Quality—outcomes focus on the ability of beneficiaries to achieve 
enhanced productivity levels and higher earnings; and iii) Job Access—outcomes related to 
connecting people (especially women and youth) to jobs from inactivity, unemployment, and 
underemployment. It will also address the underlying structure of data and information required to 
measure FTE jobs in these three dimensions. Besides supporting the M&E system of the LDDP, 
the note will inform the M&E systems of future livestock operations to engage a more systematic 
assessment of job outcomes.
The expected output of this activity is a technical note outlining the job measurement framework 
for the livestock operations highlighting a results chain of livestock operations to job outcome. 
Timeline 
The original completion date was August 30. As explained in the last progress update, both the 
Bank team and the client team have been heavily engaged with COVID-19 related emergency 
responses and the CERC component (US$ 96 million) in LDDP has been activated to address the 
impacts COVID‑19 in the sector.

Progress (as of December 2020)
This activity has progressed well in recent weeks and the drafting of the technical note is underway now.
The following tasks have been completed so far for this activity:
(i)	
A review of relevant literature has been conducted to reflect insights from the available 
knowledge to the technical note,
(ii)	 A results chain has been developed to demonstrate links between the project inputs to the 
expected job outcomes, 
(iii)	 A set of relevant indicators has been identified to capture the job outcomes from livestock 
operations, and 
(iv)	 A format for data collection to capture various types of job outcomes has been developed. 
Grant Activity 2
Activity II—Establishing a baseline for job indicators and an ex-ante estimation of job 
outcomes: This activity will estimate the baseline and ex-ante jobs outcome of the livestock and 
dairy development project in three dimensions described above. The activity will allow capturing 
jobs effect of the project along the value-chains with accuracy and showcasing the number of jobs 
created through the largest investment of the bank in the livestock sector. Although most of the job 
outcome of the project will be direct, an effort will be made to capture other indirect/induced jobs 
impacts along the whole livestock value chains, including backward linkages to input providers and 
forward linkages to processors, wholesalers, and food retailers. Key job outcomes and indicators, 
identified in Activity I, may include the number of FTE jobs created (job creation), number of FTE jobs 
with increased labor productivity or increased formality or reduced seasonality (quality job); and labor 
force participation rate among project beneficiaries, especially among women and youth (job access).
The expected output of this activity is a report on the estimation of baseline and ex-ante job 
outcomes of the LDDP. 
Timeline 
Expected to be completed by May 2021. 
Progress (as of December 2020)
This activity is a subsequent task and will utilize the framework developed under the first activity. 
Thus, this task will start following the completion of the Activity I. However, preparatory tasks 
(such as preparation of the ToR, identification of a potential consulting firm, and the development 
of survey instruments, etc.) are well underway. The recruitment process of the survey firm will start 
following the completion of the technical note under Activity I. Overall, this activity is on track for 
the completion within the planned timeline. 
The engagement of the client in the implementation of this activity has been discussed and ensured. 
A ToR has been drafted and will be finalized once the technical note from the Activity I is ready.

Lessons learned and client engagement
What problems did the task team encounter during implementations and what were 
some lessons learned? What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS 
scale up to more operations?
•	 The COVID-19 pandemic has moved the priorities of the client and the implementation of many 
regular project activities has been stalled due to the pandemic.
•	 Also, early exchanges of knowledge and ideas with the client about the importance of capturing 
job outcome of the project helped to bring the client on board for this task in addition to their 
original M&E activities and the results framework (RF) of the project.
•	 Engagement at the preparation stage of a project can yield better results through the inclusion 
of job measurement of project activities into the project M&E function and RF.
What did the task team do to build capacity in client countries (including NGOs, CSOs, 
and government agencies)?
The task team is in the process of providing technical assistance to the client to build capacity 
for capturing job outcomes of the project through their regular M&E process.

Two consultants are hired for this assignment. The first consultant is carrying out the following 
activities: 
•	 Collect relevant information and develop sample frame for selected agricultural value chains 
through communicating AGP team and other institutions (USAID, ATA and EAIR).
•	 Develop survey tool (both qualitative and quantitative) to capture permanent as well as 
temporary jobs created under the project.
•	 There will be data to be collected from regions. Prior to going out for field work the consultant 
has to attend a mandatory security training. Currently, taking the online course. When completed, 
will go out for field data collection.
Likewise, the second consultant is carrying out the following activities: 
•	 Setup the latest version of Ethiopia’s Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). The earlier version 
available have issues such that some agricultural value chains are mixed up, some factors 
such as labor and non-agricultural capital were also slightly mixed up. In the latest version, the 
consultant has sorted out all these issues. 
•	 Synchronize this latest SAM with IFPRI’s Dynamic Recursive Computable General Equilibrium 
(CGE).
•	 Trying to calibrate productivity and labor related parameters into the CGE.
SOUTH SUDAN
SOUTH SUDAN RESILIENT AGRICULTURAL LIVELIHOODS PROJECT
P169120
Development objective
To improve food availability in the country through increased investment in seed production, farmer 
capacity building, and promoting mechanization in agriculture.
Grant Activity 1
Functional study on upstream and downstream job creation in ag / food value chains. The 
RALP will be investing to support actors along the value chain input—on farm—output. This activity 
will finance a firm contract to carry out the grant activities. First, it will catalogue the ways other 
donors are starting to support producer groups/cooperatives and enterprises, via a desk review 
supplemented by select interviews. Second, it will collect qualitative data on how to support job 
creation in input markets. RALP’s design already has a significant amount of support to jobs linked 
to upstream input markets given the urgent need to create supply chains for seeds, tools / machines, 
and information / training. There are plans to support agro-dealers and producer groups / cooperative, 
and development partners, such as FAO, are already testing methods of organizing farmers into 
groups and introducing intermediate technology (e.g. animal traction, walking tractors, solar 


## Page 75
irrigation). Third, it will track how post-harvest activities—processing, grading, storage, transport, 
marketing, etc.—can generate significant jobs. Development partners have distributed processing 
equipment to communities through a now-closed project, but the Jobs ASA shows agriculture 
processing is one of the enterprises / jobs about which youth have the most doubts. This activity 
will follow up on this finding by analyzing through desk review and qualitative data collection how 
processing has been supported and what changes could increase interest in these jobs.
Timeline 
Development of the RALP project was delayed by three events: complications in the overall country 
portfolio (e.g., alternative implementation arrangements) that slowed the processing pipeline; the 
COVID‑19 outbreak that, for a while, directed energy away from agriculture and toward health 
concerns; and the desert locust outbreak, which further directed energy to swarm management 
and recovery.
However, RALP is now on a rapid preparation schedule with a planned Board date of February 
2021. The design is being finalized with Ministry of Agriculture & Food Security and FAO as the 
implementer. The development of ways to stimulate input and output market jobs (including 
establishing baseline data and appropriate indicators and studies on job creation) have already been 
discussed, and this grant is how the RALP team will develop the job creation analytical framework 
for the project. The project does now have components on producer group formation and support, 
seed supply development, appropriate mechanization, producer training, and agro‑dealership 
development. An urgent need is to identify and describe the different forms of support being 
provided by different donors, and to pilot and study the different approaches under RALP to 
determine what works best and why?
Deliverables:
(i)	
Report outlining donor efforts to form and capacitate farmer/producer groups and to support 
agro-dealerships (Originally May 2020 / Revised January 2021)
(ii)	 Report outlining engagement principles with farmers, traders, artisans, etc.—particularly 
women and youth—that produces diverse investment plans geared to developing enterprises 
and jobs around agriculture. (Originally February 2021 / Revised April 2021)
(iii)	 A brief report outlining the obstacles (real and perceived) to develop processing jobs. (Originally 
October 2020 / Revised July 2021)
Progress (as of December 2020)
Due to the delays described above, this task is just getting started, but it will move quickly from this 
point. The grant team will join weekly design team meetings on the specifics of component activities, 
implementing arrangements, and monitoring systems—to stimulate job creation. Development 
partners on the ground and new CMU consultants can facilitate distance consultations with UN 
agencies, donors, farmer groups, and the government on the research questions asked. 
In the meantime, the team is leveraging information from high frequency surveys—in person before 
COVID‑19 and over the phone since the pandemic began. This an idea on the level of activity in 
agriculture linked livelihoods upstream and downstream from the farm.

Grant Activity 2 
Job indicators for the project results framework. To track job creation, the grant will recommend 
appropriate indicators that meet SMART standards and provide guidance on how to measure 
them. This activity may include travel, workshops, and staff / STC time to help ascertain what are 
meaningful and feasible measures of jobs outcomes. It may be accompanied by highly targeted 
qualitative or quantitative work to help fine-tune measures.
While the preparation of RALP was delayed, the grant team did continue gathering data on the 
types of employment happening in rural areas to help frame the activity once it started. RALP 
M&E system is now being designed, and it will be finalized through the team design meetings 
and intensive interactions with FAO and MAFS. The goal will be to go through the entire design of 
the project and determine the nature of the jobs that could be created—e.g., full-time / part-time; 
self‑employed / salaried, and at what part of the value chain—and how they can be measured. 
Timeline 
Discussions on the revised timeline have been ongoing as the COVID‑19 shut down continued. 
RALP design began in earnest in July once the project was cleared through concept. Discussions/
planning for the workshop commenced on 9/24/2020 with a team design meeting involving the 
World Bank, FAO, UNOPS, and MAFS.
Deliverables:
(i)	
A workshop to discuss indicators to measure job creation (Originally July 2020 / Revised 
January 2021)
(ii)	 A list of indicators with guidance on collection, measurement, and analysis (Originally July 
2020 / Revised January 2021)
Progress (as of December 2020)
The tasks are getting underway, but will begin by engaging MAFS, FAO, UNOPS and the Bank’s 
RALP team on the job creation goals for the project and the sector.
A brief seminar on the nature of job creation and measurement will be offered to ensure everyone 
is clear on the concepts to be promoted. 
The team will then develop a list of potential indicators and definitions for discussion among 
stakeholders on their feasibility in the South Sudan context. 
This will cover the first few months of the grant. 
Lessons learned and client engagement
What problems did the task team encounter during implementations and what were 
some lessons learned? What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS 
scale-up to more operations?
•	 The main challenges with client engagement in South Sudan before COVID‑19 was the ability 
to get time with the client, especially since the associated lending product had been delayed. 


## Page 77
•	 Accommodation limitations in Juba constrained the ability to have a mission, and it was 
important not to raise client expectations as issues with the portfolio pipeline were clarified. 
•	 When the COVID‑19 outbreak began, the Bank staff and clients were diverted with the COVID‑19 
and the locust emergency responses 
•	 Despite those limitations, team members have been able to leverage other work to determine 
that there is a strong interest in agricultural jobs, a unfamiliarity with agriculture processing jobs, 
a more robust farmer organization structure in the country that originally presumed will help in 
conceptualizing the nature of agriculture jobs that should be created. 
•	 More importantly, in the interim, the Government of South Sudan has started to recognize 
agriculture, livestock and fisheries as important sources of job creation outside of the oil sector. 
What did the task team do to build capacity in client countries (including NGOs, CSOs 
and government agencies)?
•	 Since the grant activities were delayed, we have not built capacity with the client yet, and 
earlier, the alternative implementation arrangements in place presented and especial challenge 
to building the capacity of the national government. 
•	 In recent months, the agenda has shifted, and is now more conducive to government capacity 
building, and the design of the RALP project reflects this change
•	 Therefore, this activity can work more closely with MAFS counterparts not only on understanding 
the different type of jobs that can be created and how to measure that, they can also gain 
capacity in systemic tracking of job creation to lobby for sufficient investment in agriculture and 
related enterprises to create jobs through investment programs. 
UZBEKISTAN
UZBEKISTAN LIVESTOCK SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
P153613
Development objective
To improve livestock productivity and access to market in selected regions of Uzbekistan.
Grant Activity 1: Measuring Jobs Created
The objective of this activity is to measure (direct and indirect) jobs that the project had helped 
create thus far and will help create in the future. This includes developing and employing tools to 
measure and monitor jobs created or to be created in the sector and analyze the nature of these 
jobs in terms of productivity and compensation. 
In terms of measuring jobs created directly, the firm identified a total of 290 (out of a total 504) 
beneficiaries in five (out of a total of 13) regions. The five regions constituted over 58% of direct 
project beneficiaries and more than 60% of the credit line disbursed to beneficiaries in the form of 
sub-loans. Besides, these regions collectively represented all categories of credit line beneficiaries, 
A N N E X  C

## Page 78
including dairy, beef (cattle), meat (sheep and goat), poultry (egg and meat), apiculture (honeybee) 
and aquaculture (fish) farmers; and (dairy and beef) processors/agri-businesses. The sampled 
290 beneficiaries are being interviewed using a questionnaire developed for that purpose, which 
includes, among other questions, the nature of the business and business capital, number of 
existing employees (both permanent and casual), additional number of jobs created as a result of 
the sub‑loan, salary and/or remuneration to employees, working condition of employees etc.
In terms of measuring jobs created indirectly, the sampled beneficiaries will be asked/interviewed 
about business partnerships that they had established as a result of the sub-loans. A very good 
example in this regard is poultry production. Poultry farms often managed to create indirect jobs 
through the sale of day-old chicks to small holder farmers who in turn started their own poultry 
(broiler or layer) farms. So, the question is how many such partnerships have been established and 
led to the creation of how many jobs. It is also expected that such business partnerships are highly 
likely to be established in dairy (where cows are sold by dairy farms to small holder farmers by way 
of culling), beef (where aged bulls might have been sold by beef farmers to small holder farmers) 
and meat (where sheep and goat farmers do the same). Dairy farmers might have also established 
business partnerships with milk collectors who would collect milk from their farms and deliver them 
to dairy processing plants. 
Timeline 
Initially, the plan was to finalize this activity by September 2020. However, with the COVID-19 related 
strict lock-down that became effective on 16 March 2020 and run until May 2020, it had become 
very difficult to start the work. This had forced the team to look for alternative ways of getting the 
job done. Thus, the team decided to adopt a different approach i.e. recruit a local firm and get the 
job done instead of the initially planned international consultant. This necessitated revision of the 
TOR, which the team managed to finalize within the shortest time possible. Following the revision 
of the TOR, the team identified and recruited a local firm who would undertake the consultancy. 
There had not been any change in methodology or output in shifting from international to local 
consultant since the methodology initially planned and now being implemented is a formal survey 
using questionnaire developed for the same purpose. The only change is the way the survey is now 
being undertaken, i.e. digital rather than physical or face to face. The firm jump started the work, 
including preparing the inception report, in the shortest time possible, and is now fully on board. 
The firm is in the process of data collection right now and is expected to deliver the final report by 
30 January 2021. The new completion date is different from the one indicated in the GFR (delayed 
by a month). This is caused by the COVID-19 outbreak that had led to a strict lock down, which in 
turn had restricted any movement, including suspending missions and associated travels (both local 
and international). 
Progress (as of December 2020)
Following the approval of the SEJLS Proposal (linked to the UZ LSDP) in January/February 2020, as 
stipulated in the proposal, the team immediately started undertaking preparatory activities, including 
preparing TORs and recruiting consultants. As such, the team prepared two terms of references 
(ToRs)-one for an international consultant and another for a local consultant. The team then went 
ahead with identifying as well as getting the consent of the international consultant who would 
participate in the work, including scheduling the visit to Uzbekistan. As preparations advanced, the

## Page 79
Government of Uzbekistan (GoU) announced the first strict lock-down on 16 March 2020. The lock-
down restricted any movement/travel, including international travel and travel in the country, as well 
as limited the number of staff in government offices, including staff of project implementation units 
(only key staff were allowed to come to the office). The GoU started easing the lock-down only at the 
end of May (29 May 2020) but has announced the re-instatement of the strict lock‑down on 10 July 
2020 that extended until end of July. Following this, the firm started working on the consultancy and 
prepared the Inception Report on 6 August 2020. The firm is currently in the middle of data collection. 
Grant Activity 2: Lessons and Good Practice
The objective of this activity is documenting lessons learned and good practices. This includes 
distilling lessons by identifying and documenting good practices in measuring jobs created in 
animal source food value chains in terms of quantity and quality, which will in turn be useful for 
designing subsequent operations in the livestock sector that are pro-jobs. In undertaking this task, 
the consulting firm would be assisted by the task team and the jobs GSG.

Lessons learned and client engagement
What problems did the task team encounter during implementations and what were 
some lessons learned? What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS 
scale up to more operations?
The problem the team encountered during implementation is the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
strict lock down that was declared following the outbreak. The team initially planned to recruit an 
international consultant who would lead the work with a support from a local consultant in the 
form of facilitating data collection, administrative arrangements etc. However, travel restrictions 
imposed following the strict lock down made this difficult. This in turn had forced the team to be 
flexible and look for alternative ways of getting the consultancy work done, including revising 
the TOR, shifting from using international consultant to using a local consulting firm, using 
digital technologies for the survey instead of a face-to-face etc. One of the lessons learned is 
to always be prepared for such eventualities and include elements of flexibility in the design 
and implementation of such activities. Using local consulting firms also plays an important role 
in building and enhancing local capacity hence needs to be promoted. 
What did the task team do to build capacity in client countries (including NGOs, CSOs 
and government agencies)?

As part of ensuring effective implementation of the jobs consultancy work, which is part and 
parcel of the parent (livestock) project, the team provided physical capacity building to the client, 
including procurement of digital and IT equipment and/or facilities, and transport facilities that 
facilitated on-line supervision, travel and follow up. The SEJLS fund did not directly finance any of 
these but rather benefited from them. The fact that the SEJLS fund financed a local consultant 
firm to do the job is also capacity building in client countries.

The proposed grant will contribute to the second PDO—reduce pollution discharges from key 
sources—of the proposed IDA project. By analyzing environmental, health and safety (EHS) 
performance and job vulnerability of targeted polluting industries, the grant will help the IDA 
project to develop concrete actions to improve EHS performance and address job vulnerability 
of the targeted industrial sectors. The grant will also support the integration of job indicators and 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan into the IDA project’s results framework and M&E plan. In 
doing so, the grant will support the IDA project to transform dirty and unsafe jobs to clean and safe 
jobs of the targeted industries. 
Activity 1: EHS Performance and Vulnerability Survey ($50,000). This activity will carry out a survey 
of EHS performance and gender and youth employment of a key polluting industry (brick sector) 
that will be supported by the IDA project. Together with the technical study to be carried out as 
part of the preparation of the IDA project, this activity will support the development of an EHS and 
vulnerability action plan for the targeted industry to systematically improve its EHS performance. 
This plan will be integrated into the design of the IDA project.

The COVID-19 crisis has a significant impact on (eco)tourism in Cambodia, thus additional support 
has been provided to the Royal Government of Cambodia in assessing the impact and recommending 
a way forward. 
Progress (as of December 2020)
Tasks in progress:
•	 The concept for the study on the economic impacts of ecotourism has been prepared and 
discussed with the client. 
•	 The socio-economic survey will collect baseline data on ecotourism related job and income-
generating activities. 
•	 The socio-economic survey, the study on economic impacts of ecotourism, and findings of the 
Enabling Ecotourism Development in Cambodia report will inform the definition of potential 
tourism-related skills training programs. 
•	 Ongoing support is being provided to the RGC to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the 
ecotourism sector and define ways forward also in terms of capacity needs related to WASH 
in the tourism sector. 
Tasks completed:
•	 Enabling Ecotourism Development in Cambodia report finalized and published: The report 
provides clear guidance to the Royal Government of Cambodia on what needs to be done to 
develop ecotourism development under the Cambodia Sustainable Landscape and Ecotourism 
Project. It provides insights into the importance of ecotourism as an economic driver in 
Cambodia, the legal frameworks involved with making it happen, who the tourists and the 
stakeholders are, and the challenges and barriers that have frustrated the development of the 
sector. Most importantly, it offers a set of strategic actions that, if implemented, could build 
the environment needed to allow ecotourism to survive this current challenge and also thrive 
going forward.
•	 Policy Note on Enabling Ecotourism Development in Cambodia has been drafted. 
Lessons learned and client engagement
What problems did the task team encounter during implementations and what were 
some lessons learned? What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS 
scale up to more operations?
Challenges and lessons learned:
•	 MoE’s capacity on livelihoods activities is rather low and the engagement with the private sector 
has been slow. Engaging with private sector partners and thinking outside the box in terms 
of value chains/products to develop are relatively new to the client and close accompaniment 
and by the task team is required to advance the activities and make use of the excellent 
recommendations provided by the 4P consultant. Recommendations need to be linked to close 
implementation support.

•	 COVID-19 has strongly impacted on livelihood and (eco)tourism activities in the country. While 
it has resulted in significant job and revenue loss, the pressure on natural and forest resources 
has increased. However, there is also increased attention and awareness of the potential of 
conservation compatible job opportunities in the recovery from the crisis, and our work is 
gaining momentum. 
What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS scale up to more 
operations?
It would be useful for the SEJLS team to support the exchange with other projects/activities, 
and to help to disseminate lessons learned and good practices (e.g. methodologies for M&E 
indicators, good practice in terms of responding to job loss during COVID-19). Ad-hoc support 
in the review of ToR, reports, etc. is useful, but learning and dissemination of resources could 
be made available to a larger audience and reach more projects to benefit from SEJLS. 
What did the task team do to build capacity in client countries (including NGOs, CSOs 
and government agencies)?
•	 On COVID-19: The team worked to gather data and support the client with recommendations 
for interventions on ecotourism in the short- medium and long-term in the following areas: 
1. Governance, Regulatory and Organizational Measures; 2. Fiscal and Monetary Support; 3. 
Industry and training support; 4. Destination and Products Development; 5. Tourism Branding 
and Marketing; 6. Improving Health, Hygiene, Sanitation and Service Delivery.
•	 The work on ecotourism has been very collaborative, engaging development partners, NGOs 
and the private sector. Not only has this helped to foster the ownership of the recommendations 
by the client but has also built the capacity of government staff in better understanding the 
needs and requirements of the partners in the sector. 
•	 Particularly the 4P consultant has engaged very closely with the client and the private sector, 
aiming to map needs and expectations. Several roundtable discussions, presentations and 
workshops have been held to raise awareness and strengthen the client’s ownership of 
this activity.

Expect completion of this report by March of 2021.
Progress (as of December 2020)
The report is being prepared now and there is a rough draft incorporating analysis of national census, 
labor force survey, economic census.
 The assessment will make use of administrative data (national census, labor force survey, economic 
census) to create an I-O and/or local employment multiplier model, supplemented by surveys 
as required, to estimate investments and job creation through direct employment, supply chain 
linkages, and wider economic effects. It will include estimates on level of employment and wages 
by activity.
Grant Activity 2
Development of jobs monitoring framework for implementation M&E: Framework and workplan for 
monitoring economic impacts of the economic zones (within the zones and in the wider economic 
area) during project implementation and beyond.
Timeline 
Design of the M&E framework will be completed in March 2021.
Implementation awaits commencement of the project which has been delayed because of COVID.
Progress (as of December 2020)
The team has provided an early draft of the proposed M&E framework to the World Bank project 
team and this has been approved. We are looking at sources of data and partners to develop the 
baseline survey which is required to set the benchmarks for the framework.

Grant Activity 3 
Labor market profiling and needs assessment with gender focus: Report providing labor market 
needs assessment and gap analysis, based on the skills requirements of initial investors in BSMSN. 
The output will include: 1) a profile of the local labor force (compiled through labor force survey, 
census, and supplementary surveys) assessing education levels and occupational skills, along with 
other relevant workforce characteristics; 2) analysis of gender-specific dimensions of the labor force; 
3) an assessment of labor demand and specific skills requirements of initial investors; and 4) a gap 
analysis and recommendations on training and labor market information services that could help 
close the gap. Included in the labor market profiling will be a gender dimension. As there will be 
many female employees, especially in the garment factories in the new zones, it will be important 
to ensure that the female labor market entrants have the right training and support.
Timeline 
Labor market profiling and needs assessment with gender focus has not started. We expect to 
begin activities in December and finalize report by June 2021, before BSMSN is fully operational.

Grant Activity 1: Measuring direct and indirect jobs created by the project
The objective of this activity is to support the government in measuring direct and indirect jobs in 
the project’s components.
This includes: (i) encouraging the project team to adopt more jobs-related indicators in the project; 
and (ii) supporting the government team in developing methodologies and questionnaires to 
measure direct and indirect jobs. Indirect jobs will be measured using modules related to backward 
and forward linkages (value chain surveys). 
Deliverables under this task: (i) inputs to the Project Implementation Manual (PIM) in the Monitoring 
section; (ii) support to develop questionnaires; (iii) technical assistance to financial institutions to 
monitor jobs; (iv) support to the government in implementing the baseline survey; (v) support in 
analyzing the baseline data. 
Timeline 
(i)	
Inputs to the Project Implementation Manual (PIM) in the Monitoring section—January 2021
(ii)	 Support to develop questionnaires—January 2021
(iii)	 Technical assistance to financial institutions to monitor jobs—January 2021
Progress (as of December 2020)
None of the tasks is yet completed. The PIM is in draft and would need to be completed for the 
project to become effective (effectiveness date scheduled for January 2021). Although the project 
official effectiveness date is scheduled for January 2021, progress towards effectiveness is well 
advanced. As a result, activities under Grant 1 activity could be completed earlier.
A questionnaire was drafted by the counterparts and the questionnaire will then be imputed by the 
WB team to include jobs-specific measures.
Grant Activity 2: Estimating jobs in an investment
The objective of this activity is to analyze to what extent entrepreneurs, financial institutions or 
economists are able to ex-ante estimate the number of jobs being created in a planned investment.
This includes: (i) for each SME getting a loan: compiling the job estimates from SME entrepreneur, 
from the lending financial bank and from data (average job content by $ invested for the sector 
in which the SME operates); (ii) collecting data on jobs at frequent points in time (from financial 
institutions—cf Grant Activity 1—and from the mid-line and endline surveys). 
Deliverables under this task: (i) business plan template for entrepreneurs; and (ii) analysis of the 
gaps between the three data sources (entrepreneurs, financial institutions and data) on jobs being 
created by investments made by SMEs; (iii) reporting template for financial institutions to report on 
jobs being created by their SME clients.

TAJIKISTAN
RURAL ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
P168326
Development objective
To improve the sources of livelihood for local populations through tourism and agribusiness.
Grant Activity 1
The objective of this activity is to support jobs and livelihood of populations in Tajikistan through 
tourism development. 
The activity supports training and capacity building activities to complement the REDP grants for 
community-based infrastructure, matching grants for tourism-sector MSMEs, and rehabilitation 
works on tourism sites to create jobs and improve worker skills in Khatlon and GBAO. 
Timeline 
The activity has started from August 1, 2020 and is expected to conclude December 31, 2021. 
The REDP was declared effective on July 1, 2020. The COVID-19-related crisis has caused travel 
restrictions to Tajikistan and a sudden-stop in tourism activities in the country. The crisis and 
associated travel/work restrictions also caused a delay in the implementation of REDP. 
Progress (as of December 2020)
A report with concrete recommendations to support tourism sector jobs and skill development 
has been drafted. As part of the report, an implementation roadmap including the detailed terms 
of reference for consultants to implement the recommendations in the report has been drafted. 
The capacity building activities include, inter alia, (i) astro-tourism development, (ii) tourist guide 
training, (iii) handicrafts market development, and (iv) hospitality and construction sector trainings. 
The activities envisaged under the report will complement REDP’s grant and matching grant program 
and public investment on touristic signages.

Grant Activity 2 
The objective of this activity is to create jobs and improve the livelihood of populations in Tajikistan 
through the development of prioritized agribusiness value chains. For this project, the government 
of Tajikistan has prioritized the dairy value chain and this workstream will involve: 
(1)	 The identification of job opportunities along the prioritized REDP value chain (dairy) 
(2)	 Summarizing identified opportunities, and the investment and capacity development 
requirements to harness these opportunities, into a report 
(3)	 Utilization of findings from the report by the Project Implementation Unit and the 
Agribusiness steering committee to make both investment decisions and capacity building 
implementation plans
This project will also specifically identify opportunities for vulnerable populations such as women 
and youth.
Timeline 
It is expected that project implementation will commence in October 2020 and be finalized in 
September 2021.
Progress (as of December 2020)
For the agribusiness component, a consultant is currently being recruited to support this work 
stream. A TOR has been developed and is being finalized.

and an outline of the learning module is also being discussed with WB staff with OPCS / gender 
expertise. The plan for interviews and videos will be completed by end-September.
Grant Activity 2
Taking stock of the results of the supported reforms and the effectiveness of the M&E 
framework design.
This activity would provide lessons for other future gender DPOs regarding how to set up the results 
chain in a way that is sustainable and leads to the desired outcomes.
Deliverables: Report linking results framework to monitoring tools implemented by government and 
analyzing their effectiveness.
Timeline 
Original: Every 3 months until closing date.
Progress (as of December 2020)
Project became effective in June 2020; first report will be delayed due to various factors (counterparts 
and consultants were unavailable because of competing COVID-related priorities). The team expects 
the first report to be available January 2021.
Grant Activity 3
Continued dialogue on child care. Given the lack of care services in Albania, which places a 
burden on women’s time and availability to perform other economic activity, the team proposes to 
continue working with the authorities around (i) improvements to the afterschool program “Let’s 
do Homework,” based on findings from the World Bank assessment, including on monitoring and 
evaluation systems; (ii) organization of a workshop on international practices in early childhood 
development, with a focus on childcare services for children ages 0–6, and (iii) Organization of 
knowledge exchange activities with EU countries on differentiated childcare supply modalities, 
including coverage of public and private daycare services. The results of this activity would naturally 
feed into future Bank operations as a follow-up.

FY21 (ii) and (iii)
Progress (as of December 2020)
For (1) the closure of schools during the 2019–2020 school year automatically canceled any after 
school activities and authorities had to direct all their attention to delivering education under a 
“distance learning” model for which they were not prepared. During the present year, as COVID‑19 
infection rates continue to be relatively high, after school programs are not taking place. The team is 
reaching out to the Ministry to understand whether there is a timeline to reopen and how to think 
about such plans, and whether expanding is an option under current conditions. 
Regarding (ii) and (iii) the team is expecting contact at the subnational levels to resume but remote 
connections have been difficult. The team is considering a few online resources, which would be 
ready to be delivered to the authorities during 2021, depending on the conditions.
Lessons learned and client engagement
What problems did the task team encounter during implementations and what were 
some lessons learned? What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS 
scale up to more operations?
Aside from the difficulties associated to launching new activities in a context of no travel and 
only VC meetings, there have been no unusual issues related to SEJLS. The approach followed 
by the Jobs group to identify selectively champion projects was very effective to deploy the 
resources relatively quickly; however, to gain even more impact the team may want to consider 
helping teams at early stages of dialogue (perhaps even during ASA completion) to have a 
greater impact on the preparation process, which is typically underfunded. 
What did the task team do to build capacity in client countries (including NGOs, CSOs 
and government agencies)?
Over the years, the team benefited from a UFGE TF that allowed to generate vast knowledge 
and many exchange events, this is what led to the definition of the reform program behind the 
Gender DPO.

TURKEY
AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT FOR REFUGEES AND TURKISH 
CITIZENS THROUGH ENHANCED MARKET LINKAGES
P171543
Development objective
Improving the conditions to create formal employment opportunities in rural areas of selected host 
communities.
Grant Activity 1
On the supply-side (workers), the assessment will identify current constraints among refugee 
workers in accessing better employment opportunities in and outside agriculture. The assessment 
will identify employment preferences of refugee workers along several dimensions of job 
attributes, and weight those job attributes against the social benefits refugees can receive in the 
absence of a formal work activity. The assessment will also collect information on other potential 
constraints faced by refugees in accessing better employment opportunities in the agricultural 
sector, which could include a lack of technical or language skills, issues related to job search and 
intermediation, limited geographical mobility, or legal constraints associated with refugee status, 
among others. The findings of the supply-side assessment will directly inform the design of the 
project Agricultural Employment Support for Refugees and Turkish citizens through Enhanced 
Market Linkages—(P171543). It will also inform the design of another operational project on the 
integration of refugees in the urban labor markets of Support for Transition to Labor Market for 
People under Temporary and International Protect—(P171471). Finally, it will inform the Emergency 
Social Safety Net (ESSN) exit strategy of the Turkey government for Syrian Refugees, which aims 
at facilitating the transition from the emergency cash transfer system for refugees into labor 
market activities.
On the demand-side (farmers), the activity will assess the willingness of farmers to hire workers 
formally depending on potential workers’ attributes and the extend of labor cost subsidization 
provided by the project. The activity is expected to take the form of a field experiment in the 
form of an auction experiment carried out among farmers in provinces targeted by the project. In 
particular, the field experiment would assess the willingness of farmers to formally hire workers 
depending on workers attributes (e.g. Refugee worker versus native worker) and alternative 
wage subsidy amount The results of this sub activity will inform the design of the supply-side 
interventions as part of the Agricultural Employment Support for Refugees and Turkish citizens 
through Enhanced Market Linkages—(P171543), in particular the design of the subsidy subsidizing 
labor costs. 
Deliverables: Technical background paper on supply-side assessment—Technical background paper 
on demand-side assessment.

These timelines are consistent with the timeline set out in the GFR. However, the data collection 
methods used for the activities in this component may be revised in light of the containment 
measures and travel restrictions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Progress (as of December 2020)
On the supply-side, the team has agreed on the methodology to carry out the supply-side 
assessment. It was agreed that a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) administered to refugees in 
the field is the best instrument to assess employment preferences of refugee workers. A series of 
hypothetical employment choices with differing attributes randomly manipulated will be provided 
to respondents (e.g.). Choice problems will be designed to reflect uncertainty (for example, 
there is a risk of not being able to find informal employment during a season) as well as dynamic 
considerations (SuTP’s will lose ESSN benefits permanently once they accept a formal job; making 
it salient that the ESSN is not a permanent program, etc.). Piloting and focus group discussions will 
be used to determine which attributes are important to the local context as well as their appropriate 
levels, implying that the choices can be detailed further before implementation. In addition to the 
DCE, the field survey will also collect detailed demographic and background information on refugee 
workers, so that work preferences can be linked to refugee workers observable characteristics. The 
survey instrument for the activity is currently being drafted.
On the demand-side, the team has agreed to use a lab-in-the-field experiment design. The team 
defined the objectives of the lab experiment which will be twofold: (i) to assess preferences 
farmers’ preferences in hiring agricultural workers as well as (ii) price elicitation to determine the 
optimal level of subsidy for the project. In the first stage of the experiment, the team will test for 
potential statistical and taste-based discrimination in the hiring of refugee and Turkish workers by 
experimentally varying workers’ ethnicity and productivity. In the second stage of the experiment, 
In Stage 2, the wage subsidy will be introduced and experimentally varied to assess its impact on 
the number of workers hired by farmers by ethnicity. 
As next steps, the team needs to finalize the lab-in the-field experiment method to be used to elicit 
preferences and prices which will either be an auction mechanism, or the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak 
(BDM) preference elicitation mechanism. The team will also assess the adequate amount of 
compensation to be provided to farmers to participate in the experiment and where the experiment 
should be carried out to maximize participation. Finally, the team will determine whether the pay-offs 
to farmers resulting from the experiment will be tied to the actual project and whether they would 
be restricted to the experiment itself.

Grant Activity 2 
The activity will design a pilot intervention that addresses one of the market failures/constraints 
to formal employment creation for refugees identified by the assessments. Based on preliminary 
evidence from the field to be confirmed by the assessment, this activity could consist in designing 
a matching methodology/algorithm for formal rural employment to maximize the welfare of both 
workers and employers. The activity will also propose a Theory of Change based on market failures 
identified by the assessments then linking them to the results chain, and finally describing the main 
features of the economic analysis.

Assessment activities to serve as input for the pilot intervention defined. However, further work on 
the pilot design will be based on the outcome of activity 2. 
For the theory of change—economic analysis, the team has drafted an economic analysis for the 
overall project. The next step is to share it with the jobs group for review and comments to move 
towards finalization.
Lessons learned and client engagement
What problems did the task team encounter during implementations and what were 
some lessons learned? What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS 
scale up to more operations?
To date, the task team has been able to carry out the proposed tasks well, working within the 
task team, in consultation with local academics in Turkey. To date, no issues have emerged. 
What did the task team do to build capacity in client countries (including NGOs, CSOs 
and government agencies)?
The intention is to carry-out the proposed activities in close collaboration with the Agricultural 
Credit Cooperative, which is implementing the project, so that they can both help coordinate 
the relevant activities but also learn about the methods used and approach to this research, 
with the aim of building their knowledge and experience.

UPPER EGYPT LOCAL DEVELOPMENT PFORR
P157395
Development objective
To improve the business environment for private sector development and strengthen local government 
capacity for quality infrastructure and service delivery in select governorates in Upper Egypt.
Grant Activity 1
Baseline: Analysis of jobs across governorates and districts of Upper Egypt. This activity will prepare 
a mapping of jobs across governorates and districts of Upper Egypt.
Timeline 
Implementation start date: August 2020
Expected completion date: December 2020
Progress (as of December 2020)
The first part of analysis under this activity has already been completed. We have produced a 
note clearly outlining the key constraints faced by firms in the Upper Egypt region and other 
lagging regions using the WB Enterprise Survey. The data show that “Southern Upper Egypt” 
(which includes those governorates being supported by the Bank-financed Program) and “Frontier” 
regions of the country clearly come out as two lagging regions where firm constraints are reported 
as very different, especially compared to leading regions of the country such as Greater Cairo 
metropolitan region.
We are now launching a short analysis on productivity and lack of agglomeration economies in 
the region, where we will try to identify and distill key issues related to agglomeration economies 
including the extent of these economies and congestion costs, potential causes of the problem 
and estimate how governorates are delivering productivity. For this we plan to use the Economic 
Census and Labor Force Survey.
Grant Activity 2
Describe in detail this activity supported by SEJLS:
Local market failures: Analysis of local market failures in Upper Egypt. This analysis will aim to 
answer the question of whether public policies are incentivizing capital-intensive economic activity 
or labor-intensive economic activity, with the latter expected to create more jobs. We expect that 
there are several incentives for local firms to buy more equipment but not to hire more labor. We will 
A N N E X  C

## Page 98
look into the skills level of labor in Upper Egypt and skills currently required by businesses there. We 
will also conduct a primary survey of firms in local clusters as well as existing and potential firms 
currently located in, or interested in locating in industrial zones in Upper Egypt. This will provide 
firms’ views on local job creation and help identify viable policies and investments. This survey will 
also cover how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted local firms, especially their labor 
force and its employment status.

assessments and identifying the relevant experts.
Grant Activity 3
We plan to merge Grant Activity 3 and 4 into one, given their clear linkage.
Grant Activity 3: Recommendations: A note on spatially-aware interventions for job creation in Upper 
Egypt; and
Grant Activity 4: Guidance note on measuring jobs: A guidance note on measuring jobs indicators 
linked to urban and territorial development interventions
This note will focus on how to reduce cost of labor rather than cost of capital for Upper Egypt 
businesses, to enable them to hire more labor. We will try to identify policies / ways to subsidize 
activities to reduce the cost of labor for firms, to give firms an incentive for labor intensive activity. 
We will also try to identify policies and interventions which help the Upper Egypt region leverage its 
endowments and promote local economic development. We will also aim to measure the number 
of sustainable jobs created by private sector in firms that have benefited from interventions of 
the Bank-financed Upper Egypt Program, and how the Program has helped reduce market and 
coordination failures to enable future job creation. We will not necessarily focus on jobs created 
during project implementation by construction type activities as these may be temporary.

ANNEX D: 
PROGRESS REPORT ON ACTIVE GRANTS
TF0A2832 | Improving Jobs of Smallholder Women Farmers 
COUNTRY / REGION: Mozambique 
TTL: Joao H. C. Montalvao Machado 
GLOBAL THEME(S): Gender 
OBJECTIVE:
To identify, through rigorous research, effective policies to address underlying economic and social 
gender inequality in Africa and increase the take-up of these policies by the Government and the 
private sector. The grant shines light on constraints hindering women farmers’ technology adoption, 
access to markets, and entrepreneurship. Using a RCT approach, this project develops, implements, 
and rigorously measures the impact of two training interventions in the context of a feeder road 
rehabilitation program led by a WB project in Tete province, Mozambique. An agricultural extension 
program provides training on best farming practices and basic agribusiness skills (“hard skills”) 
through group sessions on demo plots and individual mentoring visits. A psychology-based personal 
initiative training teaches women farmers to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset focused on pro-
activeness, future orientation, and perseverance (“soft skills”). The study provides evidence on the 
effectiveness of these interventions and how they interact with improved rural road infrastructure. 
APPROACH: 
This grant-funded design and implementation of two training interventions targeted at female farmers 
in the context of a feeder road rehabilitation program led by WB project in Tete province, Mozambique. 
The impacts of these interventions are being evaluated using a rigorous RCT approach. The study 
comprises 2,240 women in 112 villages located along three feeder roads in Angonia, Macanga, and 
Tsangano districts. Two of these roads were selected to be rehabilitated under a WB-funded project. 
The rehabilitation work took place between February, 2017 and December, 2019. The villages are 
equally distributed along the three roads. Along each road, half of the villages are located 0–2 km away 
from the road, and the other half are located 2-10 km away from it. Within each village, 20 female 
farmers were randomly selected to participate in the study. The villages were randomly allocated to 
three groups. The first group comprised 37 villages (740 women) receiving an agriculture extension 
program. The second group comprised 38 villages (760 women) receiving both the agriculture 
program and a psychology-based personal initiative training. The third group comprised 37 villages 
(740 women) receiving neither intervention, serving as a comparison group. The random assignment 
of the villages across the three experimental arms was stratified by road, distance to the road, and 
the terciles of village average agricultural yields (estimated using the baseline household survey data).
Households and villages were first surveyed in February to June 2016 (baseline) on the agricultural 
season of 2014/2015. The same households and villages were interviewed again (i) in February through 
A N N E X  D

## Page 100
April 2019 (first follow‑up) on the agricultural season of 2017/2018, during which the interventions
took place; and (ii) September through November, 2019 (second follow‑up) to collect information on
the agricultural season of 2018/2019.
PROGRESS IN 2020:
Throughout 2020, the research team has finalized the data analysis to measure the impacts of
the two training interventions. Results show that the Personal Initiative (“soft skills”) training
fostered entrepreneurship outside the farm: doubling the share of women running profitable off
farm businesses, generating important additional source of income to the households.We also find
that Personal Initiative training enhance the effectiveness of agricultural extension (“hard skills”)
intervention: leading to large increases in area cultivated and adoption of fertilizers, pesticides, good 
farming practices (such as crop rotation and mulching) and cash crops (including soy), generating 
greater overall value of harvest and value of harvest sold. Importantly, we also find that household
expenditure goes up, and results persist after interventions have left the field.The team is currently
drafting a policy brief and an academic paper and will focus on disseminating the results. 
LESSONS LEARNED:
• Results show how a psychological mindset training targeted to women farmers can lead to 
greater investment and entrepreneurship, helping their households transition out of subsistence 
farming and into market‑oriented agriculture and off farm businesses.
• The results also suggest the promise of psychology to improve the design and effectiveness
of standard agricultural extension programs, showing the importance of teaching not only best 
production technologies and practices, but also developing an entrepreneurial mindset.

together diverse stakeholders, and using knowledge to achieve high-impact programming for youth 
employment at scale. Generate key knowledge and partnership products that provide a shared and 
common platform of metrics and knowledge on youth employment.
APPROACH:
Continued support of the S4YE partnership and board, supplemented with building of new private 
sector partnerships. Leveraging financing for greater learning will include co‑sponsorship of the
development of global goods, large‑scale networking, and dissemination events. Grant‑financed
activities include preparation of the S4YE flagship report on youth employment; the first interim
annual S4YE report with thematic focus, plus toolkits for practitioners; and content development
for the S4YE website (http://www.s4ye.org).
PROGRESS IN 2020:
This year the team further scaled up S4YE activities across all pillars of the work program, in spite 
of challenges due to COVID. The team produced two solid thematic notes on topics that were not 
addressed as much within theWBG.The first note was on Job creation in the Orange Economy and
the second was Digital Jobs for Youth with Disabilities. The note on disabilities also brought together 
a unique group of WBG teams and external partners, including the Global Disability Advisor team 
in SSI GP.The team also led two MDTF Solutions Notes on Digital Jobs forYoung Women and Jobs
for Young Syrian Refugee Women. The team updated the Knowledge Repository of tools for youth 
employment practitioners adding several new theme, such as on green jobs, disabilities, and jobs in
agriculture. This repository has become a go-to place for practitioners. The team also led a monthly 
series of very successful and well attended webinars bringing in new ideas and innovations from 
outside the Bank-to-Bank teams. Our monthly newsletters with crisp summaries of new reports, 
events, among other things, have been well appreciated. The team also successfully supported 
several WBG operational teams bringing in the digital jobs agenda to operations in Ethiopia, Iraq,
Cambodia, Lebanon, Sierra Leone, and other countries. S4YE partnered with different GPs in all
activities especially with Social, SPJ, Education, DD, Agriculture, FCI, and also scaled up partnership 
with IFC’s team on education/digital skills.

TF0A4831| Impact Evaluation of South Africa Youth Job Search Assistance 
COUNTRY / REGION: South Africa 
TTL: Eliana Carranza 
OBJECTIVE:
To examine the role of labor market frictions in private sector development in South Africa. This 
research will specifically contribute to understanding the implications of imperfect information for
labor market screening, firm productivity, and growth.
A N N E X  D
93


## Page 102
APPROACH: 
By testing ways to overcome information asymmetries, this evaluation will inform dialogue around 
effective interventions to boost private sector growth, firm labor demand, and employment. The 
evaluation will take place through approaches such as (i) designing an online platform with worker 
profiles, (ii) conducting qualitative interviews with firms to validate the platform design, (iii) identifying 
small and medium enterprise (SME) firms for participation in the study, (iv) piloting the online platform, 
and (v) collecting baseline survey data and platform-based monitoring data. 
The project team partnered with Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator to implement a 
work‑seekers study and firm study. The project uses a series of field experiments to identify how 
information sharing concerning work seekers’ skills changes the work seekers perception about their 
abilities and the labor market, as well as firms’ responses to their applications. The work-seekers study 
tests and provides work seekers with information about their own skills and aptitudes. Work seekers 
receive a certificate that allows them to credibly convey this information to prospective employers 
through a branded test certificate. Complementary to this intervention, the firm study identifies 
the effects of providing more information about candidates’ skills directly to firms. An interactive 
“Skillfinder” platform created and offered to firms contains more than 6,000 work seekers profiles and 
test assessments. The information provided to firms is randomly varied and therefore work seekers 
are randomly matched to jobs. 
PROGRESS IN 2020:
All data collection, data analysis, policy notes and dissemination activities planned for this period 
were completed. A working paper with impact evaluation results was produced and published in 
the World Bank Policy Working Paper Series, the Harvard Center for International Development 
(CID) Faculty Working Paper, Oxford University and Duke University Economic Research Initiatives 
(ERID). An implementation manual for the skill certification activities was developed with Harambee 
and published at the Jobs Group and Oxford. The manual is targeted to a more operational audience 
who may be interested in replicating the activities. Jointly with our partner JPAL a methodological 
note was also produced. The note summarizes best practices for surveying young and highly mobile 
work-seekers over the phone, which draws from experience with data collection for this and other 
projects (including two also funded by the Jobs MDTF). The note has been well received by policy 
practitioners. Impact evaluation results have been disseminated broadly to academic and policy 
audiences, both in South Africa and internationally. Two blogposts were prepared and published 
at VoxDev and GlobalDev (English, French and Spanish). Presentations were given at the BREAD 
conference, and AEA/ASSA annual meetings. 
LESSONS LEARNED: 
•	 Findings indicate higher employment rates, higher earnings, and more accurate beliefs about 
their skills among work seekers who received a skills certificate. The intervention does not seem 
to change work seekers’ search behavior (neither effort nor effectiveness), providing evidence 
of limited information frictions on the supply-side. Instead, demand-side information frictions 
exist and seem to be more quantitatively important for labor market outcomes.
•	 Our estimates of demand suggest that labor market service providers could at least partially 
finance their operations through payments from participating firms. Impacts were similar for 
male and female work-seekers and firm-owners.

• In bulk‑scraping multiple online job vacancies, our team noticed many misleading, questionable,
and low-information posts. These were eliminated in a careful curation process before 
implementation. Those posts included jobs with unrealistic salaries or unrealistic prospects,
jobs that required “training fees”, and multi‑level marketing jobs.The frequency of posts like this
was worrying and represents a search barrier to young inexperienced workseekers.
• The results also suggest the promise of psychology to improve the design and effectiveness
of standard agricultural extension programs, showing the importance of teaching not only best 
production technologies and practices, but also developing an entrepreneurial mindset.

TF0A4483 | Mexico Youth Labor Market Inclusion Pilot 
COUNTRY / REGION: Mexico 
TTL: Alvaro S. González 
OBJECTIVE:
To pilot and evaluate innovative approaches to improve employment outcomes for youth transitioning 
from school to the labor market.The project also supports linking labor market demand and supply by
decreasing firms’ job search and turnover costs.Targeted beneficiaries comprise low‑income youth
graduating from upper secondary school, including past and present beneficiaries of conditional
cash transfer programs.
APPROACH:
Contribute to government efforts through design, implementation, and IE of a multisectoral model
based on existing government programs. Project design is informed by a diagnosis study and a
thorough consultation process with federal and local government officials, NGOs working on youth
employment, targeted youth, business associations, and private sector firms. Project activities
include a labor market literacy workshop delivered at schools by the Public Employment Services 
office (SNE); an economic incentive delivered directly to project beneficiaries to promote access to,
and staying in, formal employment; and a remote‑based strategy to monitor and support take‑up of
project activities and high‑frequency tracking of youth’s trajectories.
The project is implemented in two phases. Phase I (MM 2018–MM 2019) tested implementation
mechanisms and validated potential hypotheses regarding youth constraints. Results from Phase I
informed project activity design improvements for Phase II (MM 2019–to date), which started
implementation in 2020. 
PROGRESS IN 2020:
Phase II began in April 2019 by collecting baseline data and delivering a labor market literacy
workshop at upper secondary schools by trained SNE staff. At the end of the workshop, a randomly
selected sample (970 youths) of targeted youth (total sample of 1,924) received an offer to obtain a
A N N E X  D

## Page 104
formal employment incentive (FEI) if they were able to provide evidence of formal employment and 
permanence in formal employment after graduating from upper secondary education. The stimulus 
was offered to selected youth regardless of their plans after graduation. The amount of incentive
offered was MXN 900 monthly (approximately US$ 45). The incentive is paid for up to six months,
as long as the participant demonstrates formal employment. The FEI intervention is ongoing. There 
is no deadline to claim the incentive, and youths who receive the offer can claim the incentive any
time after finding a formal job, for a single time (they cannot reapply once they have received it).
A total of 970 youth were randomized to receive the incentive offer, and 55% were planning at
baseline to search for a job after graduation. To date, out of those, 383 individuals have registered
to receive the incentive, 285 have self-reported being formally employed, 213 have received their 
first incentive payment, and 151 have completed six months receiving the incentive.
To reduce high rotation during the first six months on the job, the FEI was initially designed to be
paid for up to six months, continuously, as long as the participant demonstrated their permanence 
in formal employment at the same firm. However, in response to the COVID‑19 crisis and labor
market pressures introduced by the pandemic, the condition of staying at the same firm was relaxed
in March 2020. Now, it is only required that participants remain formally employed, regardless of
whether they had changed firms and whether this change occurred or not immediately after leaving
the previous job. The team informed about this modification by SMS to all individuals assigned to
the treatment group.
LESSONS LEARNED:
• Building trust and ensuring continuous communication with youth are crucial elements to ensure 
participation in active labor market programs.
• More than half of the students plan to work either full or half time after graduating from high 
school. Yet, few schools invest in providing labor market information to students
• More than 80 percent of students have work experience; however, most of that experience has
been in the informal sector

TF0A5052 | Round 3: Côte d’Ivoire Economic Inclusion and Value Chains: Pilot
COUNTRY / REGION: Côte d’Ivoire
TTL: Luc Christiaensen
GLOBAL THEME(S): Fragility, Conflict, and Violence (FCV)
OBJECTIVE:
Explore the effectiveness of integrated jobs approaches, the pilot develops a rice value chain by
supporting rice processing units (labor-side intervention) and including producer organizations and 
poorer smallholders within (supply-side intervention).

APPROACH:
Within the broader context of the Côte d’Ivoire Productive Safety Net project, the pilot focuses 
on “action learning” and development of rice value chain that includes smallholder farmers. The 
impact evaluation compared labor market and welfare outcomes attained through (i) a value chain 
development approach, (ii) cash transfers, and (iii) synergies from combing the two.
PROGRESS IN 2020: 
In 2019, smallholders received inputs on credit from a financial institution based on a contract with 
a rice mill to deliver a certain amount of rice, of a certain quality, at a fixed harvest price. The mill 
received working capital credit from the micro-finance institution to buy rice at harvest and followed 
up regularly with participating villages through a liaison agent hired at its own expense. The Jobs pilot 
paid coordination costs—including one agricultural liaison officer—invested in capacity building, and 
facilitated partners’ exchange (mill, farmers, local micro-finance branch) through local and national 
coordinators, and provided technical assistance to mills and agronomic advice to farmers. Participating 
partners carry the financial risks; no guarantee funds for loans nor subsidies for inputs are provided. In 
return, partners must offer all rice growers (with some form of water control), including the poorest, 
the opportunity to participate. 
The Jobs project team documented, evaluated, and communicated progress and lessons, and 
conducted administrative and household surveys about credit transactions, yields, and sales, as well the 
socio-economic profiles of about 550 participating and non-participating households from 52 villages 
around three rice mills in three regions (Tonkpi, Poro, Tchologo) in 2019. Evaluation revealed that while 
many did not generate a profit, some farmers demonstrated good results. But there were substantial 
implementation challenges, leading the partners to make program changes after year one, including 
limiting participation to farms with appropriate and sufficiently large lowland rice plots, streamlining 
provision of credit and reducing its cost, intensifying agronomic extension, and replacing a rice mill with 
another willing to offer a higher price. The second year, about 450 mostly new producers across 60 
villages participated. Although no partners made a profit (farmers, mills, bank), they made progress and 
most remedial measures had a positive effect. Use of machinery services also brought considerable 
benefits. Seed quality and COVID-related input delivery delays created liquidity challenges and reduced 
performance in two regions. The partners decided to undertake one more campaign adopting more 
changes, including tightening rules of participation, upfront payment of 10 percent of the credit as 
guarantee to ensure farmer commitment, and decentralizing decision making for credit provision and 
input purchases to the local consortia. Mills also received marketing strategy assistance. Early results 
from a new round of data collection showed that contracted “semi-lux” rice production was most 
profitable for mills, but it requires better quality paddy rice, greater contracted volume, and better firm 
management. Mills will be encouraged to introduce a quality premium. 
LESSONS LEARNED: 
Several lessons are emerging during implementation from the results of the first agricultural season 
the pilot accompanied:
(i)	
Moving from subsistence farming to market production applying modern inputs requires a 
long-term mentality shift. 
(ii)	 Agronomic support is key to increasing smallholder productivity and output quality.


## Page 106
(iii) Some water control is needed for commercial rice production; intensified rain‑fed production
is not profitable.
(iv) Rice marketing increases price (white rice), which in turn permits greater margin to mills and 
thus a higher price for farmers (paddy rice). 
(v)
Credit delivery models are not appropriate in a rural context, especially where farmers are 
not organized. 
(vi) While a contracting model can benefit all actors, it requires strong supply chain coordination
and participation of everyone. It takes time, collaborative spirit, and flexibility, as well as good
feedback loops to learn and adjust.
(vii) Distributing risks among all actors (including input providers) remains challenging.
(viii) Experiments including data collection, analysis and communication on value chain and 
contracts are crucial to generate evidence for policy dialogue. 
(ix) Insights from this project informed design of an IFC rice project in Côte d’Ivoire focusing on
a few large mills.

LESSONS LEARNED:
• It is crucial to keep the WB country management unit (CMU) and Donors informed about 
evolution of grant implementation and to ensure key stakeholder buy-in. 
• It is challenging to design a small pilot project. It takes time for the pilot to be designed in a way
that adds value to the CMU, the work of operational teams, and the broad analytical agenda. It 
may take time to determine best allocation of resources.
• While challenging and time consuming, it is important to integrate the project into other teams’
work. However, thanks to its quality and accompanying analytical work, the project has been
well received and has informed other work; for example, the Jobs Diagnostic, which was helpful
in designing a new operation on youth employment in Mozambique.

Introduction
MESSAGE FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT
This was a year dominated by COVID-19 and the ensuing global health and economic crisis. The pandemic 
has taken lives and disrupted livelihoods in every corner of the world. It has raised the urgency of mitigating 
severe economic impacts on poverty and overcoming the dangers of climate change, systemic inequality, 
social instability, financial risks, declining growth rates, and conflicts.
The World Bank Group’s ongoing response to the COVID-19 crisis has been massive and decisive, with trust 
funds and financial intermediary funds (FIFs) contributing to immediate relief initiatives and providing strategic 
support to countries as they rebuild for a resilient recovery. This report highlights the important work trust 
funds and FIFs are supporting to help shorten the crisis and lay a strong foundation for a future that is more 
prosperous and better prepared for disasters like COVID-19. 
Ongoing trust-funded activities are part of the World Bank Group’s efforts to build this foundation of greater 
resilience. Looking across the thematic areas of health, climate action, gender, social protection and jobs, 
and debt management, this report shows how trust fund and FIF resources—disbursing $51.62 billion from 
fiscal years 2017 to 2021—support the World Bank Group’s goals to end extreme poverty and promote shared 
prosperity through greener, more inclusive and more resilient development. 
Trust funds and FIFs complement the core funding and activities of the World Bank Group, increase the scope 
and reach of its activities, and further its knowledge and learning agenda. They help address global and regional 
issues that transcend national boundaries and make it possible to support countries, such as non-members 
and those in arrears, where the World Bank Group cannot provide financing from its own resources. 
This report also examines how the World Bank Group brings value to trust-funded partnerships. Its convening 
power, at both the international and country level, optimizes coordinated action on shared development 
priorities to achieve impact at scale. Partners benefit from the World Bank Group’s extensive technical expertise, 
country experience and supervision capacity, and its ability to monitor and report on results. Ongoing reforms 
in trust fund and FIF management also ensure strategic alignment, efficiency, transparency, collaboration, and 
predictability in the use of resources. As part of the drive to enhance financial sustainability, new measures are 
also being implemented to recover costs in delivering externally funded activities.
Partnerships are at the core of trust fund and FIF success, and we thank all our development 
partners, implementing partners, and client countries for their engagement, 
collaboration, and dedication to our shared mission and vision. Our work ahead is 
more critical than ever. Together, we are building on forward momentum to generate 
a resilient recovery that ensures a broad and lasting rise in prosperity for all.

**Image Description:**
The image is a close-up photograph of a group of children, all wearing face masks. The children appear to be in a classroom or a similar indoor setting. The focus is on a girl in the foreground who has a blue face mask, colorful clothing with a predominantly blue pattern, and a dark backpack on her shoulders. She is looking directly at the camera.

Behind her, several other children are visible. Some are wearing yellow and green garments, and most of them are also wearing face masks of various colors. The background is blurred, emphasizing the children in the foreground.

There is no visible text within the image itself. The image likely accompanies a section of an annual development report, possibly related to education, public health, or community support programs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic or similar health measures.

WORLD BANK GROUP TRUST FUNDS AND 
FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY FUNDS

WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021
Introduction
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 
TOWARD GREATER RESILIENCE
The COVID-19 crisis has affected economies around 
the world and shocked every sector from health 
and the environment to education and jobs to the 
macroeconomy and government debt, to name just 
a few. The impacts of the pandemic have cascaded 
into developing markets and hit vulnerable 
populations especially hard. COVID-19 has severely 
disrupted access to many essential health services, 
particularly in the poorest nations with the most 
fragile health systems, and has spawned the worst 
crisis to education and learning in a century. Rising 
global inequalities, lagging progress in economic 
and social development, multiple prolonged violent 
conflicts, and increased forced displacement have 
all been exacerbated by the pandemic. Women and 
girls have borne the brunt of impacts at work and 
in the home.
The World Bank Group has mounted a broad 
and decisive response to the crisis—the largest 
in its history. From April 1, 2020 through June 30, 
2021, the World Bank Group committed over $157 
billion, including $45.6 billion in financing from 
the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (IBRD) for middle-income countries, 
$53.3 billion in concessional financing and grants 
from the International Development Association 
(IDA) for the poorest countries, $42.7 billion from the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) to private 
companies and financial institutions, $7.6 billion 
in guarantees from the Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) to support private 
sector investors and lenders, and $7.9 billion for 
recipient-executed activities supported by trust 
fund resources (Figure 0.1).

The World Bank Group’s crisis response has 
provided an opportunity to support a strong, 
durable recovery that tackles rising poverty and 
deepening inequality while addressing both the 
immediate devastation wrought by the COVID-19 
pandemic and the longer-term challenge of 
climate change. Green, resilient, and inclusive 
development, or GRID, is the Bank Group’s 
renewed and refocused approach to collective 
action on interlinking challenges. 
This Trust Fund Annual Report, Toward Greater 
Resilience, speaks to the many ways that trust 
funds and financial intermediary funds (FIFs) 
are contributing to the World Bank Group’s 
effort to help client countries respond to the 
ongoing health and economic crisis stemming 
from COVID-19 and recover without significant 
setbacks to their long-term development agendas. 
Covering July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 (fiscal year 
2021 or FY2021), this year’s report provides an 
overview of the World Bank Group’s trust funds 
and FIFs totaling $40.24 billion in funds held in 
trust as of June 30, 2021. The report focuses on 
their core strengths, institutional efficiencies and 
reforms, key results and impacts from the field, 
and financial trends and analytics. Highlighted 
activities illustrate the strong commitment and 
support of contributing development partners 
in addressing the development objectives of 
client countries. 
TRUST-FUNDED ACTIVITIES  
ADD VALUE
Trust funds and FIFs are an integral part of the World 
Bank Group’s development assistance architecture. 
They complement the core funding and activities 
of the Bank Group’s institutions—IBRD, IDA, IFC, 
and MIGA—by providing financial resources 
and contributing to development knowledge 
and operational innovations. The flexibility and 
responsiveness of trust funds and FIFs help to 
expand World Bank Group lending operations, 
generate new knowledge, and pilot projects. 
They help test cutting-edge approaches for scale 
up, advance development finance innovations,

**Image Description:**
The image depicts people standing in line inside a metro station, likely waiting to enter or board a train. The layout shows a queue of individuals positioned on floor markers that encourage social distancing. These markers are circular, with blue borders and white backgrounds, containing text that reads "Mantén un metro de distancia" (which translates to "Keep one meter distance").

Key elements in the image:
- Several people facing away from the camera or to the side, spaced apart on designated floor markers.
- A young girl in the foreground wearing yellow pants and a light denim jacket, along with pink face mask and a clear face shield.
- Another person directly ahead, wearing a black jacket and jeans, standing on a social distancing marker.
- A yellow wall with a row of windows or doors (likely entrances to the metro trains).
- Overhead lights with a textured ceiling above.
- Blue signs on the windows or doors with the text “Estación Central.”
- People wearing a variety of jackets and backpacks.

Overall, the image visually conveys the theme of safety measures and social distancing in public transportation systems, which is likely relevant to an annual development report focused on urban infrastructure or public health compliance.

and provide technical assistance, advice, and 
training to build stakeholder capacity and enhance 
sustainability. Trust funds and FIFs also build on the 
World Bank Group’s convening power and global 
and local presence to bring value to clients.
In FY2021, the World Bank Group disbursed $3.82 
billion in trust fund resources (not including FIFs), 
the bulk of which, $3.57 billion, was disbursed by 
the World Bank (IBRD and IDA combined). Almost 
three-quarters of World Bank-disbursed trust 
fund financing, or $2.55 billion, went to recipient-
executed activities on the ground, representing 
approximately 5 percent of the World Bank’s total 
project disbursements. IDA-only countries were 
the largest recipients at 66 percent, followed by 
IBRD countries (17 percent), IBRD-IDA blend 
countries (7 percent), and the balance to global or 
regional activities. 
The World Bank disbursed the remaining $1.03 
billion in trust fund resources toward Bank-executed 
activities, including knowledge generation, analytical 
activities, and project implementation support. 
Over the past five years, trust fund disbursements 
for Bank-executed activities have represented 25 
percent of the Bank’s administrative expenditures, 
including 63 percent of total expenditures for 
advisory services and analytics (ASA). 
IFC Advisory trust funds are a small but critical part 
of IFC’s overall budget, and are used to build the 
capacity of private sector clients, especially in IDA 
countries. IFC trust funds increasingly support IFC’s 
Creating Markets Upstream approach to create 
bankable projects in the most challenging settings. 
IFC’s blended concessional finance trust funds are 
also an important and growing tool for creating 
markets and stimulating development. The strategic 
use of concessional funds for projects with high 
development impact can catalyze private financing 
that would not otherwise be available and support 
the creation of new markets.
World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs also 
support global public goods that help advance 
key development issues that transcend national 
boundaries, including climate change, fragility, and 
pandemic preparedness and response. Many FIFs 
look to the World Bank Group as an implementing 
partner of choice. Trust funds and FIFs also allow 
a broader pool of contributors, including non-
governmental entities, to channel funds toward 
World Bank efforts to enhance global public goods.
Moreover, trust-funded activities allow the World 
Bank Group to provide development resources 
to non-member countries, countries in arrears, 
and non-sovereign entities that cannot receive 
Bank Group financing. MIGA, for example, works 
with development partners to leverage its limited 
resources and to increase the risk appetite of 
private investors in challenging environments. 
By collaborating with development partners to 
establish specialized guarantee trust funds, MIGA 
mobilizes guarantee capacity in high-risk states 
affected by fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV), 
where its operations would be limited.
IBRD/IDA trust fund grants are also a critical 
financing source for investments and technical 
assistance for recipient-executed activities in FCV 
situations. In FY2021, about 50 percent of total trust 
fund disbursements for recipient-executed activities 
were made to FCV-affected countries, concentrated 
in five locations: Afghanistan, Sudan, West Bank and 
Gaza, Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo. Effective implementation of these 
activities is subject to the shifting circumstances on 
the ground in some of these countries.
TRUST-FUNDED ACTIVITIES 
HELP BUILD RESILIENCE 
Trust funds and FIFs are making important 
contributions to all three stages of the World Bank 
Group’s pandemic response: relief, restructuring, 
and resilient recovery. This report sheds light on 
the ways in which trust-funded activities are fast-
tracking funding to emergency needs, boosting 
support for the most vulnerable, and extending the 
World Bank Group’s reach to help countries around 
the world end the pandemic and emerge stronger, 
more united, more equitable, and more prepared 
for future challenges. By the end of FY2021, IBRD/
IDA trust funds had committed $1.13 billion to 248 
World Bank operations that are helping countries 
respond directly to the COVID-19 crisis. They are 
enhancing access to lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines 
and treatment, and keeping students learning and 
governments solvent, among many other actions.
As the Bank Group looks ahead with its GRID 
approach, it brings into focus progress already 
being made in strengthening resilience across 
systems and society. The report showcases results 
stories from the field that illustrate how, over the 
past five years, trust funds and FIFs have supported 
World Bank Group projects and programs in health, 
climate action, gender, social protection and jobs, 
and debt management—all essential building blocks 
for greater resilience.  
• In Cambodia, the Health Equity and Quality 
Improvement Program (H-EQIP) Multi-Donor 
Trust Fund is driving reforms across the health 
sector that have helped to reduce the proportion 
of households vulnerable to high health care 
costs by 43 percent from 2015 to 2020.
• In Colombia, funding from the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF) has played a  
critical role in reducing deforestation, conserving 
biodiversity, and fostering climate resilience in 
the Amazon, including piloting a community-
based approach to land-use planning that the 
Government of Colombia is scaling up across  
the Colombian Amazon.
• In East Africa, the Umbrella Facility for Gender 
Equality (UFGE) has funded research and a pilot 
program that is showing how digital financial 
service providers can tailor their product  
offerings and marketing to attract more  
women in agriculture. 
• In Zambia, the Girls’ Education and Women’s 
Empowerment and Livelihood (GEWEL) Multi-
Donor Trust Fund is helping to expand the 
successful Social Cash Transfer Program, which 
seeks to reach 30 percent of the Zambian 
population and 50 percent of the poor by 2022.
• In Georgia, ongoing engagement through the 
Debt Management Facility (DMF) had enabled 
the country to build a framework for greater 
resilience in government debt management, so 
that it was able to respond effectively when the 
COVID-19 pandemic shocked the economy.
• In the Middle East and North Africa, funding 
from IFC’s MENA Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises (MSME) 2.0 Trust Fund and the 
Partnership for Resilient Efficient and Sustainable 
SMEs Facility supported the development of an 
interactive webinar series that is helping MSMEs 
increase their business resilience in the wake of 
the COVID-19 crisis.

combining existing IBRD/IDA trust funds, as well 
as establishing new programs. This has enabled the 
World Bank to mobilize resources more strategically, 
efficiently, and effectively to help client countries 
achieve their development objectives.
A new Cost Recovery Framework for IBRD/IDA 
trust funds was launched in FY2021. Building 
on the previous one, this framework is simpler, 
easier to communicate and more predictable. The 
new framework aims to support and maintain the 
budget 
sustainability, 
including 
implementing 
targeted efficiencies and economies of scale, and 
increasing cost recovery. The new framework also 
increases the recovery of the World Bank’s indirect 
costs associated with trust funds over time, while 
maintaining some level of contribution from the 
Bank in recognition of the partnership nature of 
trust funds. 
IFC has initiated a proactive and strategic review 
of its fundraising efforts and use of trust funds to 
ensure alignment with its 3.0 Strategy and Creating 
Markets Upstream approach in support of private 
sector investment opportunities. The trust fund 
reform process has centered around IFC’s new 
corporate Funding Needs Assessment (FNA), which 
has allowed IFC to streamline governance and align 
development partner fundraising with its strategic 
goals and ensure development partner funds are 
appropriately balanced with IFC’s resources. By the 
end of FY2021, the FNA was fully integrated into 
IFC’s annual budgeting process, thereby facilitating 
more 
focused 
strategic 
partnerships 
with 
development partners. 
The World Bank Group also began implementing an 
updated FIF Management Framework in FY2020. 
This is helping to increase upstream engagement 
with development partners and shape the dialogue 
around the continuum of financing instruments 
available to meet development objectives and keep 
aid fragmentation in check. Discussions around new 
proposals now systematically include consideration 
of building on the existing aid architecture, including 
existing FIFs. No new FIFs have been established 
since FY2018.

continuously improve the effectiveness of trust 
fund resources and activities. The World Bank’s 
latest reform to transition the IBRD/IDA trust 
fund portfolio into fewer and larger Umbrella 2.0 
Programs aims to deliver transformative solutions for 
client countries and development partners through 
improved strategic alignment, increased efficiency, 
reduced fragmentation and transactions costs, and 
enhanced management oversight. 
For development partners, the reform elevates the 
World Bank-donor partnership to focus on strategy, 
enables collective action at scale on development 
challenges, supports knowledge exchange, and 
strengthens results reporting and visibility. For 
clients, the reform facilitates better alignment of 
trust fund activities with country priorities and 
enables trust fund resources to be better integrated 
in World Bank country programs.

The World Bank Group is organized to work across 
the entire development spectrum, at the country, 
regional, and global levels, to facilitate coordinated 
action for solutions that support its mission to end 
extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. 
The Bank Group’s increased presence in more than 
160 offices worldwide helps to understand better, 
work more effectively with, and provide more timely 
services to its partners in those client countries. 
This geographic spread—combined with a renewed 
delivery model that strengthens cooperation among 
sectoral and regional teams across the World Bank 
Group and increases focus on fragile states—help to 
strategically align resources with the Bank Group’s 
priorities and rising demand from client countries to 
achieve better development outcomes.
The role of trust funds has evolved dramatically 
during the last few decades, and the World Bank 
Group has undertaken initiatives and reforms to

WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021
Introduction
READING THIS REPORT
This report and its accompanying volumes delve 
deep into the contributions of World Bank Group 
trust funds and FIFs during the past five years 
(FY2017–21). It has the following structure:
Chapter 1 explains institutional reforms and how 
trust fund programs add value to the World Bank 
Group mission and complement the work of its 
various arms. It examines how the Bank Group’s 
convening 
power 
and 
technical 
capacities 
strengthen international partnering initiatives to 
achieve collective goals more efficiently than one 
partner could achieve by itself. 
Chapter 2 looks at how trust funds and FIFs have 
supported the World Bank Group’s response to the 
COVID-19 crisis. Fast-acting and targeted trust-
funded activities have helped in relief, restructuring, 
and resilient recovery efforts to save lives, protect 
the poor and vulnerable, ensure sustainable 
business growth and job creation, and strengthen 
policies, institutions, and investments.
Chapter 3 takes a broader view to showcase how 
trust funds and FIFs have supported World Bank 
Group public and private sector efforts in health, 
climate action, gender, social protection and 
jobs, and debt management during the past five 
years. These themes illustrate the diversity and 
strategic value of trust-funded activities in building 
the foundations for greater resilience now and 
into the future. 
Chapter 4 provides financial information and 
analytics on the activities of World Bank Group 
trust funds and FIFs, as well as externally financed 
outputs. It examines five-year trends on trust 
fund and FIF inflows, outflows, and assets under 
management—all of which demonstrate the World 
Bank Group’s position as the partner of choice in 
advancing development agendas in countries, 
regions, and around the globe. 
2021 Yearbook of Trust-funded Results is a separate, 
complementary document that expands on the trust-
funded activities referenced in the report. It shines 
more light on development partner contributions, as 
well as the work of beneficiaries and stakeholders 
on the ground. 
Lessons from the Umbrella 2.0 Transition is a 
separate, complementary document that offers 
useful insights and lessons on how IBRD/IDA 
trust funds are being integrated into Umbrella 
2.0 Programs.

FUNDING AND PARTNERSHIPS

World Bank
Trust funds combine the advantages of multilateral 
aid (such as larger geographic presence, economies 
of scale, lower administrative costs, and proven 
implementation capacity) with those of bilateral 
assistance (targeted assistance in areas such as 
fragile situations where donors have limited or 
no presence). Trust funds can also bring down 
transactions costs and reduce the proliferation of 
bilateral programs. Channeling trust funds through 
multilateral institutions, like the World Bank Group, 
can also facilitate the integration of global priorities 
into country programs. 
1.1 VALUE PROPOSITION OF 
TRUST FUNDS
Trust funds support the achievement of the World 
Bank Group’s goals to end extreme poverty and 
promote shared prosperity in a sustainable way 
by providing financial resources, contributing to 
the knowledge agenda, and building on the Bank 
Group’s convening power and global and local 
presence to contribute to country, regional, and 
global development.
Trust funds complement core World Bank Group 
financing. Trust funds enhance global, regional, 
and country-level knowledge and provide targeted 
support to clients to complement the World Bank 
Group’s own financing. They fund nearly two-thirds 
T
rust funds are financing instruments that 
accept contributions from one or more 
donors that are held in trust by the World 
Bank Group as a trustee and disbursed 
according to the provisions of the Bank 
Group’s Administrative Agreement with 
the donor(s) to each trust fund. Trust funds 
often create platforms and partnerships for 
financial, knowledge and other forms of 
collaboration between the Bank Group, its 
donors, its client countries, and others at 
the global, regional, and country levels.
of the World Bank’s analytical work and provide 
funding to pilot innovative ideas, support the quality 
and development impact of operations, and make it 
possible for the Bank Group to provide development 
resources to non-member countries, countries in 
arrears, and other institutions that cannot receive 
Bank Group financing.
Trust funds are used to mobilize development 
finance. For countries lacking the development 
finance to achieve their own goals, trust funds 
complement IBRD and IDA in helping governments 
build their capacity to mobilize revenue, manage 
public expenditure and public debt, and improve 
their procurement and public financial management 
systems. Trust funds support the development of 
innovative financial solutions and the mobilization of 
new, nontraditional sources of development finance.
Trust funds are used to address global and 
regional issues that transcend national boundaries, 
such as climate change, communicable diseases, 
and other shared challenges. Individual countries 
can be reluctant to borrow for county-level 
investments that contribute to the provision of 
global or regional public goods, the benefits 
of which transcend national boundaries. Trust 
funds facilitate assembling global and national 
stakeholders into partnerships to support the global 
aspects of public goods. For example, trust funds 
are helping to boost climate resilience by scaling 
up the implementation of renewable energy and 
energy efficiency measures. They are also helping 
to enhance countries’ response to the COVID-19 
pandemic and preparedness for future pandemics.
1.2 WORLD BANK GROUP AND 
TRUST FUNDS
The World Bank Group consists of five institutions: 
the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (IBRD), the International Development 
Association 
(IDA), 
the 
International 
Finance 
Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International 
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes 
(ICSID). IBRD and IDA (collectively the “World Bank”)

Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships
administer the largest number of trust funds. IFC and 
MIGA manage fewer trust funds both in number and 
volume. IBRD also manages financial intermediary 
funds (FIFs)—tailored financing mechanisms that 
enable the international community to provide a 
coordinated response to global priorities.
IBRD/IDA TRUST FUNDS 
IBRD is the largest development bank in the world. 
It provides loans, guarantees, risk management 
products, and advisory services to middle-income 
and creditworthy low-income countries, and 
coordinates responses to regional and global 
challenges. IDA, the Bank Group’s fund for the 
poorest countries, aims to reduce poverty by 
providing zero to low-interest loans and grants 
for programs that boost economic growth, reduce 
inequalities, and improve people’s living conditions. 
As of June 30, 2021, the World Bank had 529 active 
trust fund accounts at the trustee level, into which 
donors make their contributions. The World Bank 
managing unit for each trust fund account disburses 
these resources to support either Bank-executed 
activities or recipient-executed activities. 
Bank-executed (BE) activities are performed by 
the World Bank, and constitute part of the Bank’s 
work program. Therefore, trust fund disbursements 
for BE activities are comparable to and contribute 
toward the Bank’s administrative expenditures. BE 
activities support the World Bank’s work over the 
entire range of the project cycle, from upstream 
activities (such as research, learning, and advisory 
services and analytics, or ASA) to country-level 
technical assistance and capacity building to support 
for project preparation, design, implementation, 
and impact evaluations (Box 1.1). In FY2021, trust 
fund disbursements for BE activities represented a 
quarter of the Bank’s administrative expenditures, 
including 63 percent of total ASA expenditures.
Ayesha Abeyratne / IFC
Recipient-executed 
(RE) 
activities 
support 
projects that are typically executed by country-
level recipients, similar to IBRD or IDA financing. 
Like IBRD/IDA projects, Bank staff appraise and 
supervise the projects to ensure that the recipients 
execute them in accordance with World Bank 
policies and procedures. The recipients who execute 
these projects are mostly sovereign governments 
or their agencies, as well as UN agencies or non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). Therefore, 
trust fund disbursements for RE activities form part 
of the Bank’s investment project portfolio. 
Trust fund support for RE activities enables the Bank 
to expand and complement its lending program 
in several contexts, such as situations of fragility, 
conflict, and violence (FCV) or when the Bank’s 
resources are limited by IDA’s assistance envelope 
or by the availability of IBRD’s lending resources. RE 
grants can also extend the Bank’s reach to countries 
in arrears, non-members (such as the West Bank 
and Gaza), and non-state recipients, such as civil 
society organizations (CSOs), which cannot receive 
direct funding through regular Bank instruments 
like IBRD loans or IDA credits and grants. They also 
complement IBRD and IDA in providing immediate 
assistance in response to emergencies, natural 
disasters, and countries dealing with an influx 
of refugees.
Trust-funded RE activities can either be stand-
alone grants or provide co-financing to projects 
being financed by the World Bank, IFC, FIFs, or 
other donor financing. In many instances the RE 
grants effectively lower the interest rate charged 
to borrowers. They are typically accompanied by 
trust-funded BE activities that support the Bank’s 
preparation, appraisal, and implementation of the 
RE grants. Trust-funded RE activities represented 
5 percent of World Bank disbursements to client 
countries in FY2021. 
Research activities increase understanding of the economic and social issues critical to the success 
of WBG operations, inform policy dialogue, and influence development thinking more generally. 
Knowledge products inform global engagements; share existing knowledge; establish World Bank 
and international standards, indicators, and various methodologies; and inform existing and new client 
engagements.
Advisory services and analytics (ASA) are services with an external client to inform the World Bank’s 
policy dialogue and engagement strategy with a country or specified audience (such as think tanks, 
academia, NGOs, development partners, governments, and the general public) and to stimulate public 
debate about development challenges and actions at a country, regional, or global level. ASA includes 
innovative, proof-of-concept, and pilot activities leading to the development of diagnostic tool kits that 
may be used in subsequent analytical activities.
Technical assistance helps strengthen the capacity of specific institutions and individuals involved in 
policy-making or managing investments to enhance project preparation, design, implementation, or 
the sustainability of project outcomes after a project has closed.
Bank-executed activities are part of the World Bank’s work program

Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships
IFC TRUST FUNDS
IFC advances economic development and improves 
the lives of people by encouraging the growth of the 
private sector in developing countries. IFC does 
this by creating new markets, mobilizing other 
investors, and sharing expertise—all of which help 
to create jobs and raise living standards, especially 
for the poor and vulnerable. Private investment and 
private sector solutions are essential to meet the 
World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme 
poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity, 
especially given the longer-term economic impact 
of COVID-19.
IFC’s 
Creating 
Markets 
Upstream 
approach 
envisions a continuum of work, beginning with 
Advisory services (to help create the conditions for 
new investment through reform and development 
of promising business sectors) and continuing with 
support for developing specific projects in which 
IFC may invest.
Through Advisory programs, IFC works with 
clients, including companies, financial institutions, 
industries, and governments, to transform ideas into 
increased private sector investment, green growth, 
inclusive job creation, and bankable projects. IFC 
trust funds are the main instrument for financing IFC 
Advisory services, and increasingly its Upstream 
agenda, with funding coming from development 
partners, IFC, and its clients. While donor trust funds 
are an important contributor to delivery of IFC’s 
strategy, they account for a small portion of IFC’s 
total resources. 
Based on data for FY2020 and 2021, partner funding 
accounted for 13 to 15 percent of total annual 
resources. As of June 30, 2021, IFC had 158 active 
donor trust fund accounts, 54 percent of which were 
focused on IDA countries. IFC’s Advisory portfolio 
had 806 projects spanning 100 countries, with 
disbursements of more than $1.3 billion over the 
past five years.
IFC uses blended finance to crowd in private sector 
financing that would otherwise not be available. 
Relatively small amounts of concessional donor 
funds allow to mitigate specific investment risks and 
help rebalance risk-reward profiles of pioneering, 
high-impact investments so that these have the 
potential to become commercially viable over time. 
IFC takes a disciplined and targeted approach to 
blended finance governance, including following key 
blended finance principles for development finance 
institutions: rationale for blended concessional 
finance, crowding-in and minimum concessionality, 
commercial sustainability, reinforcing markets, and 
promoting high standards. 
IFC’s blended finance portfolio encompassed 20 
donor-funded programs at the end of FY2021, 
compared to 10 programs at the end of FY2017, with 
$1.45 billion in active contributions from 11 donors, 
including the IDA Private Sector Window.1
MIGA TRUST FUNDS
MIGA facilitates foreign direct investments into 
developing countries by providing guarantees 
(political risk insurance and credit enhancement) 
to investors and lenders. MIGA guarantees protect 
investments against noncommercial risks and can 
help investors obtain access to funding sources 
with improved financial terms and conditions. 
MIGA has two active trust fund accounts that help to 
expand its guarantee work in FCV countries where 
MIGA’s operations would otherwise be limited: the 
Conflict-Affected and Fragile Economies Facility 
and the West Bank and Gaza Trust Fund. These 
promote the stability and growth of FCV countries 
by catalyzing private capital flows from investors 
and financial institutions to these countries through 
the mobilization of political risk insurance products 
from both MIGA and the global political risk 
insurance industry.
1 As part of the 18th replenishment of IDA, the World Bank Group created a $2.5 billion IDA-IFC-MIGA Private Sector Window, to catalyze 
private sector investment in IDA-only countries, with a focus on FCV-affected states. The window became operational on July 1, 2017 
and is administered as a trust fund.
Going forward, MIGA plans to augment these 
two existing trust funds with two new trust 
fund 
accounts: 
one 
focused 
on 
renewable 
energy and another on advisory services to 
address the critical sustainability issues of 
governance, 
gender, 
and 
environmental 
and 
social compliance. All four trust funds will be 
brought under one coordinating MIGA Strategic 
Priorities Framework to ensure internal alignment 
and a consistent and coordinated approach.
FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY FUNDS 
FIFs are important tools in the development finance 
toolbox, offering customized financing platforms 
for partnership programs and special financing 
mechanisms that can catalyze a variety of public 
and private resources in support of international 
initiatives. 
The 
World 
Bank 
supports 
FIFs 
through tailored administrative, financial, legal, or 
operational services.
Most often launched at high-level, multilateral 
forums, FIFs enable the international community 
to provide a direct and coordinated response to 
global priorities. They serve as multi-contributor 
collaboration 
platforms, 
typically 
governed 
independently, that focus on providing large-scale 
pooled funding in support for global public goods, 
such as preventing communicable diseases, 
responding to climate change, and food security.
The World Bank manages a large and diverse 
portfolio of FIFs. It facilitates the establishment and 
operation of FIFs by offering to perform a set of roles 
and responsibilities tailored to the circumstances 
of each FIF. The World Bank is a valued partner 
as a trustee for FIFs, building on well-established 
financial, investment management, and accounting 
platforms developed over the past two decades, 
and on specialized legal and treasury services. In 
addition, the World Bank often hosts FIF secretariats, 
serves as an implementing entity for many FIFs, and 
in some cases hosts an evaluation office (Table 1.1).

The image shows a group of people, mostly women and children, gathered around an elevated concrete platform in a dry, dusty environment. Several yellow jerry cans are placed on and around the platform, suggesting that this might be a water collection or distribution point. There are also three donkeys in the scene, two standing prominently in the foreground and one near the left side, possibly used for transporting water containers.

The people are dressed in colorful traditional clothing, and some of them are standing while others are sitting or leaning against the jerry cans. A woman near the center appears to be stirring or managing something on the platform. There is no visible text in the image.

a Standard financial management services include managing contributions, holding funds received in trust, investing such funds pending 
disbursement, and committing and transferring funds to the implementing/supervising entities.
b Additional financial management services include replenishment support, cash flow projections, and reflows/repayment management.
c Customized financial management services include customized treasury management services and reporting, e.g. for AMC, IFFIm, and 
Global Fund. This also includes Certified Emission Reductions (CERS) management for AF, support for pandemic bonds and insurance 
in the PEF, and managing auctions and bond issuances for PAF.

World Bank Group’s Roles and Services in FIFs during FY2021
TABLE 1.1
The World Bank served as limited trustee and/
or financial or treasury manager for 27 FIFs that 
were active during FY2021. Of these, the World 
Bank provided the legal personality for 19 FIFs, 
hosted the secretariats for 18 FIFs, and served as 
an implementing entity for 20 FIFs. The World Bank 
takes on an implementing entity role for most FIFs 
whose secretariat is hosted by the World Bank. The 
World Bank also acts as an implementing entity for 
three FIFs with external secretariats: Climate Risk 
and Early Warning Systems (CREWS), the Green 
Climate Fund (GCF), and the Guyana REDD+ 
Investment Fund (GRIF). Two FIFs were closed in 
FY2021: the Advanced Market Commitments (AMC) 
for Pneumococcal Vaccines and the Pandemic 
Emergency Financing Facility (PEF), reducing the 
total number of FIFs to 25 at the end of FY2021. 
FIFs financed a significant portion (28 percent) 
of total RE disbursements to project supervision 
by the World Bank over the last five years. During 
FY2017–21, the largest FIF contributors to Bank-
supervised RE activities were the Global Partnership 
for Education (GPE) ($1.22 billion), the Climate 
Investment Funds (CIF) ($0.98 billion), and the 
Global Environment Facility (GEF) ($0.75 billion).
The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program 
(GAFSP) launched its FY2020–25 replenishment 
cycle in October 2020, during which it received 
$300 million in pledges for the first year of the 
replenishment period, with the goal of receiving $1.5 
billion over the full replenishment period (Table 1.2). 
In June 2021, donors announced plans to commit up 
to $2 billion to CIF to support its new Accelerating 
Coal Transition initiative. Donors also pledged $4 
billion to the GPE at the Global Education Summit 
in July 2021.
1.3 ENHANCING 
EFFECTIVENESS THROUGH 
INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES
WORLD BANK
The IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio upholds the 
World 
Bank’s 
country-based, 
demand-driven 
delivery model, in which the Bank strives to 
achieve its developmental goals through activities 
at the country level, based on decisions made by 
sovereign country authorities. This requires deep 
and customized analysis of the economic and 
social conditions in each country, and a careful 
assessment of government priorities and of the 
Bank Group’s comparative advantage within 
each country.
The World Bank has realigned senior responsibilities 
within its Global Practices to strengthen links and 
cooperation between sectoral and regional teams, 
while maintaining the flexibility of the renewed 
delivery model. This is also expected to enhance 
contestability as well as the quality of the Bank’s 
knowledge products.

Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships
Increasing 
FIF 
selectivity 
and 
oversight. 
Since FY2020, early discussions have been 
held systematically with internal and external 
counterparts on the most appropriate mechanism 
for new high-profile initiatives. In each case to date, 
it has been agreed that there was no need for a 
new FIF, but rather, objectives could be achieved as 
well or better through alternative options, including 
existing FIFs.
Increasing information sharing. In line with the 
commitment in the FIF Management Framework to 
increase information sharing on the FIF portfolio, the 
Bank presented key developments at the Annual 
Meetings and Trust Fund Forum meetings in FY2020 
and 2021. This included sharing references to recent 
reviews and evaluations of FIFs and information on 
upcoming replenishments. This Trust Fund Annual 
Report maintains the Bank’s commitment to provide 
at least annual reporting on the FIF portfolio.
As part of this realignment, a large portion of the 
IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio has been remapped 
to the Regions. This move, along with the 
continuing efforts of operational business units to 
consolidate their trust funds into fewer Umbrella 
2.0 Programs (Section 1.4), is enabling the Bank to 
mobilize resources more efficiently and effectively 
to help client countries achieve their development 
objectives, 
including 
the 
17 
Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). Larger, consolidated 
programs have greater flexibility to be strategically 
aligned and responsive to country needs. The 
Bank will be able to integrate trust fund activities 
into its annual strategy and planning processes, 
intermediating the supply of trust fund resources 
managed by Global Practices, and ensuring this is 
informed by client needs garnered from the Regions’ 
engagement with client countries.
A new Cost Recovery Framework for trust funds 
went into effect on January 1, 2021. Consistent with 
guidance from the Executive Board and feedback 
received from development partners and staff, this 
framework is simpler, easier to communicate and 
more predictable than the previous one. It aims 
to support and maintain budget sustainability, 
including implementing targeted efficiencies and 
economies of scale and increasing cost recovery. 
The new framework also increases the recovery 
of the Bank’s indirect costs associated with trust 
funds over time while maintaining some level of 
contribution from the Bank in recognition of the 
partnership nature of this instrument.
IFC 
Since launching its Creating Markets strategy in 
December 2016, IFC has embarked on a series of 
internal reforms that have strengthened World Bank 
Group collaboration while taking a more focused 
approach to market creation. IFC’s partners will 
play an increasingly important role, by providing 
funding to support sector transformation and 
capacity building and through blended finance. IFC 
is also changing the way it identifies partner funding 
needs and develops funding arrangements with 
development partners. 
In FY2020, IFC embarked on a trust fund reform 
process centered around a new corporate 
Funding Needs Assessment (FNA). It has 
streamlined governance to align development 
partner fundraising with IFC’s strategic goals 
and ensure development partner funds are 
appropriately balanced with IFC’s resources. 
By the end of FY2021, the FNA had been fully 
integrated into IFC’s annual budgeting process to 
ensure alignment with country strategies.
IFC’s new approach to fundraising for its trust 
funds works to ensure all aspects of the business 
are addressing key development challenges. This 
approach delivers a number of advantages: 
• Enables more focused strategic partnerships  
and coordinated engagement with its 
development partners 
• Presents a holistic view of IFC’s activities across 
various themes and regions to ensure alignment 
with partners’ strategic priorities 
• Improves collaboration with the World Bank 
• Increases efficiencies in the areas of trust funds, 
particularly in preparing proposals for partners 
and in allocating funds
FIF MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
The World Bank updated its FIF Management 
Framework in 2019 in response to a number of 
issues arising from the rapid growth in the FIF 
portfolio from nine to 27 FIFs between 2008 and 
2018. This growth added to the fragmentation 
and complexity of the aid architecture, with some 
unintended consequences for clients. FIFs can also 
raise significant risks for the Bank in the different 
roles it plays and at various points in their lifecycles. 
The primary objective of the updated FIF 
Management Framework has been to raise 
awareness of the challenges of some FIFs in 
responding to calls for a collective response across 
the development community and to put forward 
more concrete actions to address them, including 
the following:
• Strengthening FIF selectivity, in part, by providing 
a menu of options that the World Bank Group 
could support to respond to global calls for 
collective action and by reserving new FIFs 
for situations where there are no reasonable 
alternatives. 
• Deepening application of a risk-based approach 
for approval of new and restructured FIFs and in 
relation to major changes during a FIF’s lifecycle.
• Providing the World Bank Group’s Board with 
more regular information on FIFs, including 
new FIFs under development, FIFs that seek 
restructuring, and information on the FIF  
portfolio as a whole.
• Clarifying the Bank Group’s expectations and 
accountabilities in FIFs, particularly as the host of 
FIF secretariats and as an implementing entity. 
In FY2020, the World Bank’s Development Finance 
Vice Presidency (DFi) led the implementation of the 
framework by working in close consultation with 
other Vice-Presidential Units throughout the Bank. 
This involved the following actions:
Policy amendments. The World Bank’s Board of 
Executive Directors approved a new Trust Fund 
Policy (OP 14.40) in FY2021 and Management 
will issue a series of policy documents for staff in 
FY2022 that will further support its implementation.
FIF directives, procedures, and guidance notes. 
Extensive work has been undertaken to translate 
the direction of the Management Framework into 
updated FIF directives, procedures and guidance, 
which will be formalized in FY2022.

Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships
1.4 TRANSITIONING TO 
UMBRELLA 2.0 PROGRAMS
A 2017 review of the IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio 
revealed significant fragmentation, with about 70 
percent of the trust fund accounts contributing 
to only around 7 percent of the overall trust fund 
resources. The World Bank’s current reform of its trust 
fund portfolio through fewer and larger Umbrella 2.0 
Programs aims at delivering transformative solutions 
for client countries and for development partners 
through improved strategic alignment, increased 
efficiency, and enhanced oversight. 
Umbrella 2.0 Programs are more strategically aligned 
with Bank priorities and are expected to increase 
the use of development partners’ contributions to 
achieve better outcomes for client countries. During 
FY2021, the World Bank continued the transition 
to Umbrella 2.0 Programs by consolidating, 
redesigning, rebranding, and/or combining existing 
IBRD/IDA trust funds, as well as establishing 
new programs.
ROADMAP TO A LESS FRAGMENTED 
TRUST FUND PORTFOLIO
The role of trust funds has evolved dramatically 
during the last few decades, and the World 
Bank has undertaken initiatives and reforms to 
promote continuous improvement in the efficiency, 
strategic alignment, and robust oversight of trust 
fund resources and the activities they support. 
Prior reforms had enabled significant progress in 
transitioning trust funds to World Bank operational, 
financial, and administrative controls, including 
implementation 
of 
the 
trust 
fund 
fiduciary 
framework, which is now fully mainstreamed into 
regular business processes. 
The current trust fund reform aims to reduce 
fragmentation of trust funds. Its cornerstone is 
organizing the trust fund portfolio around a limited 
number of Umbrella 2.0 Programs. These are 
strongly aligned with the World Bank’s priorities and 
seek to enhance the effectiveness of development 
Dominic Chavez / World Bank
resources by strengthening internal oversight and 
integration with the Bank’s strategy and planning 
processes while further reducing transactions costs 
for mutual benefit. 
The process to transition the IBRD/IDA trust fund 
portfolio to one based on Umbrella 2.0 Programs 
began in early 2020 following World Bank Senior 
Management endorsement of the reform vision—
the culmination of a three-year, Bank-wide effort to 
define the design and implementation of the trust 
fund reform. Through this transition, the Bank is 
reducing the number of IBRD/IDA trust funds from 
a fragmented portfolio of 529 trust found accounts 
to 72 proposed Umbrella 2.0 Programs.
Each of the World Bank’s Global Practices and 
Regions prepared “roadmaps” in FY2020 to identify 
a future trust fund portfolio architecture that would 
support strategically driven fundraising for their 
objectives and priorities. By the end of FY2021, 
72 programs were identified, of which 48 were 
confirmed to meet the Umbrella 2.0 Principles (Box 
1.2). The complete list of Umbrella 2.0 Programs is 
available in Annex C. 
The 
reform 
has 
benefited 
from 
extensive 
engagement with internal and external stakeholders 
and funding partners, generating many valuable 
recommendations on addressing the challenges 
and opportunities. In FY2021, “Deep Dives” with 
donor agencies, consultations, and events at 
the World Bank–International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) Annual and Spring Meetings and regular 
communication buttressed development partner 
support and buy-in. 
Internally, continued engagement across the 
World Bank’s Global Practices and Regions 
helped maintain internal momentum and enabled 
continued roll-out of the reforms. Staff training was 
modernized and updated to reflect the Umbrella 
1. A single governance structure, a 
Partnership Council, that provides 
strategic guidance and direction on the 
implementation of all trust fund activities 
in the Umbrella 2.0 Program 
2. Options for development partners to 
express preferences for a specific theme 
or geographic area
3. A results framework developed in 
consultation with development partners 
to help monitor and assess how 
individual activities are contributing to 
the overall development objectives of 
the Umbrella 2.0 Program
4. A Communication and Visibility Plan 
addressing stakeholder analysis, 
branding and recognition
5. Unified reporting at the program level 
with a strong focus on results
Umbrella 2.0 Principles
BOX 1.2
2.0 Program reform, and program managers were 
convened as a network for peer learning and mutual 
support. In FY2022, a series of policy documents 
for staff will be issued pursuant to the new Trust 
Fund Policy that the World Bank’s Executive Board 
approved in FY2021. 
As the Bank’s Practice Groups, Regions, and 
Development Economics Vice Presidency transition 
to a more strategic trust fund architecture, FY2022 
will see an increased focus on improving the 
upstream integration of trust fund resources in the 
Bank’s planning cycle.

KEY FEATURES OF  
UMBRELLA 2.0 PROGRAMS
Umbrella 2.0 Programs embody a flexible approach 
to trust fund organization and management that 
enables development partners and the World Bank 
to partner and finance mutual priorities. Designed 
to address the persistent challenge of a large and 
fragmented trust fund portfolio (many small funds 
with highly customized features), Umbrella 2.0 
Programs strengthen the link between funding and 
the strategic priorities of the World Bank, its clients 
and partners, and promote impact at scale. 
A trust fund portfolio grounded in Umbrella 2.0 
Programs means fewer, larger, more strategically 
aligned funding initiatives. The umbrella architecture 
also upholds the Bank’s country-based, demand-
driven delivery model and takes advantage of recent 
corporate realignments that deepen coordination 
between World Bank Regions and Global Practices.
Each Umbrella 2.0 Program is anchored by a primary 
multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) and, in some cases, 
may include associated trust funds (Figure 1.1). In 
all cases, the anchor MDTF and the associated 
trust funds retain common governance, results 
framework, and reporting in the new umbrella 
program. The anchor MDTF is a programmatic 
trust fund with a relatively broad thematic or 
geographic scope. 
Umbrella 
2.0 
Programs 
offer 
options 
for 
development partners who are interested in 
supporting a specific theme or geographic area. 
These options can accommodate situations where 
development partners are unable to contribute 
to the main MDTF due to their internal policies 
or regulations that require dedicated financial 
reporting to track their contributions. Such situations 
are handled by establishing separate associated 
trust funds, which support activities within the 
geographic and thematic scope of the umbrella. 
The overarching development objective of an 
Umbrella 2.0 Program is that of the anchor MDTF. 
An Umbrella 2.0 Program can be global, regional, 
or single country in scope and can support one 
or more priority areas of a World Bank Global 
Practice or Region as set out in its business plan. 
Associated trust funds support the Umbrella 2.0 
Program development objective and contribute to 
the overarching results framework of the Umbrella 
2.0 Program. They have a thematic and geographic 
scope that is within the scope of the anchor MDTF.
Umbrella 2.0 Programs provide scale and efficiency while working with 
development partners’ requirements
FIGURE 1.1
Umbrella 2.0 Programs provide scale and efficiency 
for enhanced development impact and effectiveness, 
by offering the following benefits:
A more strategic way to partner with the 
World Bank and to finance priorities. Umbrella 
2.0 Programs offer an approach to organizing and 
managing trust funds in support of one or more 
shared strategic priority areas. Their broad scope 
and clear strategic focus elevate the dialogue with 
partners around shared priorities and mutually 
desired outcomes, while accommodating partners’ 
interests and aligning with the World Bank’s 
planning and budgeting framework.
Increased access to the World Bank’s Senior 
Management in the context of high-level policy 
and strategy dialogue. Umbrella 2.0 Programs 
provide greater opportunities for development 
partners and the World Bank to work together 
strategically and efficiently and deliver better 
results for clients. A single governance structure 
for all funds in a program brings the World Bank’s 
Senior Management and partners to the same 
table around common development objectives, 
helps avoid fragmentation of resources, and 
increases efficiency. 
Opportunities to collectively address global 
and local development challenges and achieve 
meaningful results at scale. Through participation 
in the Partnership Council, development partners 
review progress against the unified results 
framework; provide strategic advice on setting 
priorities, including adjusting to changes in the local 
or global context; and collaborate in and benefit 
from knowledge-sharing activities. This strategic, 
program-level dialogue allows the World Bank and 
partners to work together to help advance policy 
dialogue and to ensure that individual activities are 
aligned around common outcomes. The Partnership 
Council endorses the Umbrella 2.0 Program’s 
annual work program and budget after which 
the World Bank allocates program resources to 
individual activities.

Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships
2 In some limited circumstances, the Bank may establish stand-alone trust funds (outside of umbrella programs), for example, to  
co-finance an IBRD or IDA project, or when it would not be possible or practical to channel donor resources in an umbrella as 
determined by Management. See, for example, the Cambodia Health Equity and Quality Improvement Program on page 37.
Improved narrative and results reporting and 
greater attention to communications and visibility 
for development partners. The Results Framework 
for each Umbrella 2.0 Program is developed in 
consultation with development partners. This covers 
activities funded by all trust funds in a program. 
The results framework is the key monitoring tool to 
assess how individual activities are contributing to 
a program’s overall development objectives. Results 
progress reporting is provided at the Umbrella 2.0 
Program level and may highlight contributions from 
associated trust funds in a comprehensive report.
Increased 
access 
to 
knowledge 
sharing 
opportunities on key development issues. 
Umbrella 2.0 Programs develop Communication 
and Visibility Plans (CVP) that are discussed with 
the Partnership Council. The CVP ensures that the 
strategic communication needs of each Umbrella 
2.0 Program are considered and implemented. 
This may include stakeholder analysis, audience 
segmentation, key messaging and channel selection, 
and how these can support the overall program 
goals and drive for results. The CVP also ensures 
appropriate branding of a program, participating 
development partners, and the World Bank.
STRATEGIC FUNDRAISING
The Strategic External Funds Framework (SEFF) 
exercise was launched in FY2021 to support Bank 
Management in furthering the evolution to a more 
strategy-driven approach to fundraising. The 
exercise consolidated progress made in the shift 
to a streamlined Umbrella 2.0 trust fund portfolio 
architecture and allowed for Management to review 
fundraising plans and ensure their alignment with 
priorities. Based on the plans laid out in the SEFF, 90 
percent of trust fund fundraising will be channeled 
through the proposed 72 Umbrella 2.0 Programs, a 
higher share than previously expected at this early 
stage in the reform implementation.2
The progress made on the Umbrella 2.0 Program 
rollout and enhanced management oversight of 
fundraising have made it possible for the Bank to 
avoid a moratorium on donor outreach for trust 
fund contributions during an IDA replenishment 
year, as had been the case in the past. This new 
Responsible Fundraising approach has ensured 
that IDA20 replenishment remains the top priority 
in 2021, supplemented by strategic trust fund 
fundraising plans complementary to and supportive 
of IDA and IBRD. Moving forward, the streamlined 
SEFF will be an annual management exercise 
for reviewing and updating strategic priorities for 
fundraising and authorizing changes in the trust fund 
portfolio architecture.
In parallel with the World Bank’s transition to 
Umbrella 2.0 Programs, IFC has undertaken a 
similar exercise designed to consolidate fundraising 
in trust funds that can house multiple projects 
and programs in a single, efficient administrative 
structure. The Facility for Investment Climate 
Advisory Services (FIAS), one of the World Bank 
Group’s oldest and largest multi-donor trust funds, 
is one of the key vehicles for IFC’s approach. FIAS 
supports IFC Advisory services that foster inclusive 
private sector growth in client countries, with a 
focus on IDA, fragile states, and Africa. 
During the FY2017–21 FIAS strategy cycle, 16 donor 
countries and organizations supported FIAS-backed 
IFC teams in helping to bring about 200 reforms 
that are making it easier to invest, start, and grow 
businesses in developing countries. More than half 
of these reforms took place in IDA countries, and 
about one-fourth were in FCV-affected situations. 
The strong working-level ties that IFC teams have 
developed with their clients paid dividends as the 
COVID-19 crisis unfolded and projects in the FIAS 
portfolio pivoted to meet urgent client demand.
Victor Idrogo / World Bank
During FY2021, the FIAS team updated its strategy 
for FY2022–26, with a pipeline of projects in support 
of IFC’s Creating Markets Upstream agenda. FIAS 
will be the fundraising vehicle of choice for IFC 
Advisory services projects at the preparatory end, 
what IFC calls “Creating Markets with Sector 
Interventions.” These involve sectoral or market-
wide interventions that will facilitate private sector 
investment and for which IFC could be a potential 
financing partner.
LEARNING FROM UMBRELLA  
2.0 PROGRAMS
The transition to a trust fund portfolio based on 
Umbrella 2.0 Programs is an iterative process that 
began in FY2019 with a handful of pilot programs. 
These have helped the World Bank to learn by 
doing and to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach 
in designing umbrella programs. The pilot phase 
has given way to the launch of full-fledged 
Umbrella 2.0 Programs. 
Table 1.3 features nine recently established programs 
that are implementing the Umbrella 2.0 principles, 
including governance arrangements, preferencing, 
results frameworks, reporting, and communications. 
Their implementation experiences offer lessons that 
can help guide the continuing transition process. 
These and other lessons from early Umbrella 2.0 
Programs continue to be collected to develop 
expanded knowledge-sharing activities.
Each of these programs began their Umbrella 2.0 
journey from a different starting point and each 
is at a different stage of implementation. The 
featured programs have diverse origins, including 
long-standing legacy programs, restructuring of 
existing programs, consolidation and mergers of 
existing programs, and new programs being built 
from scratch. Their objectives are well aligned 
with the GRID approach of green, resilient, and 
inclusive development. More insights are detailed 
in the accompanying Lessons from the Umbrella 
2.0 Transition.

Behind him, the shelves are densely stocked with various packaged food products. These include canned goods, powdered milk, and other grocery items with prominent brand labels like "Gloria," "Laive," "Nestlé," and "Idea." The packaging is colorful, with blues, reds, yellows, and greens being dominant.

In the foreground, attached to a transparent barrier or glass, there is a handwritten sign in Spanish that reads: "MANTENER 1 METRO DE DISTANCIA" which translates to "KEEP 1 METER DISTANCE." This suggests a COVID-19 safety measure to maintain social distancing.

Overall, the image layout focuses on the shopkeeper amid a well-stocked small grocery environment, emphasizing health safety via the mask and distancing sign. The scene captures a moment of daily commerce with due attention to pandemic norms.

Why development partners choose to partner with the World Bank Group 
through trust funds
BOX 1.3
1.5 BRINGING THE BEST 
OF WBG TO TRUST FUND 
PARTNERSHIPS
The World Bank Group contributes to trust-funded 
programs, such as Umbrella 2.0 Programs, through 
the partnership elements inherent in them. When 
the Bank Group engages as one of the partners in 
a trust-funded program, it is not simply a contractor 
for hire that provides services for the contributing 
donors. Rather, it brings all its institutional capacities 
to bear to achieve shared objectives more efficiently 
than one partner could achieve by itself. 
From the international coalition of development 
partners and clients that constitute the World 
Bank Group to engagement with UN agencies, 
international NGOs, foundations, and civil society 
to an increasing focus on leveraging private 
capital—the World Bank Group has long recognized 
the transformative power of partnership where 
new ideas, perspectives, and experiences are 
combined with the necessary financial resources. 
Partnerships require more than financial resources 
to be successful; they need buy-in to legitimize the 
collaboration and advocacy that can extend their 
reach beyond the immediate partners.
Trust funds as a partnering mechanism have been 
in place for decades and have been instrumental 
in building upon the expertise and resources of 
multiple development partners and the World Bank 
Group. They are the most commonly used vehicle 
for funding partnerships in which the Bank Group, 
development partners, and other stakeholders work 
together to tackle a specific development issue or 
find new ways to approach problems at the global, 
regional, or country level (Box 1.3). Umbrella 2.0 
Programs are now becoming the primary way to 
partner with the World Bank through trust funds. 
A 2020 evaluation by the Independent Evaluation 
Group (IEG) found that trust funds and FIFs provide 
important convening opportunities for the World 
Bank Group to bring together relevant actors to 
address global, regional, and local development 
challenges. This is because trust funds and FIFs, 
as financial vehicles, are the essential components 
around which global partnership programs and 
other global initiatives are constructed and operate. 
The evaluation also found that the Bank Group both 
leads and supports convening in different instances. 
The leaders of partner organizations view the Bank 
Group’s comparative advantages in convening as 
its global reach, country presence, central place 
in international development networks, data and 
research, and its ability to work across sectors and to 
design and apply innovative financial instruments.3 
As the following examples illustrate, the World Bank 
Group has a unique ability to convene partners, 
draw upon its deep professional expertise and 
knowledge as a thought leader, provide trusted 
sources of development data and analysis, facilitate 
consensus on approaches to key development 
issues, and then activate these approaches in the 
Bank Group’s country operations. These abilities 
enable the Bank Group to use trust funds for the 
purpose of partnership. See more information about 
these activities and their contributing development 
partners in the accompanying 2021 Yearbook of 
Trust-funded Results. 
CONVENING MULTIPLE ACTORS
The World Bank Group is able to convene a broad 
range of actors around an agenda. For example, 
under the FoodSystems2030 Umbrella 2.0 Program, 
the World Bank is bringing together stakeholders—
from farmers to government policy makers—to 
repurpose agricultural policies to make food systems 
more resilient, sustainable, and fit-for-purpose from 
the point of view of people, the economy, and the 
planet. What started as a policy note to COP24 in 
2018 became a critical contribution to the UN Food 
System Summit in September 2021 and a key lever 
for mobilizing action under the cross-cutting theme 
on Nature at COP26 in 2021. 
ENGAGING AS A PROGRAM PARTNER
Once programs have been established, the World 
Bank Group actively engages as a partner, by 
facilitating agreements on approaches to key 
development issues, and then operationalizing these 
approaches in the Bank Group’s country operations. 
Since the formulation of its first strategy for working 
with the European Union (EU) in 2010, the World 
Bank has been a critical partner of the EU in Europe 
and Central Asia (ECA), by contributing its technical 
expertise, global experience, and ability to structure 
and deliver large-scale operations. The new 
Strategic European Partnerships Umbrella 2.0 
Program (STEP-UP) is the most recent iteration of 
this partnership, focusing on a) harnessing relevant 
knowledge and expertise, b) ensuring shared policy 
priorities for institutional strengthening, and c) 
leveraging areas of complementarity between EU 
and Bank priorities.
Since 2019, the World Bank has been convening 
partners around Gov-Tech, a whole-of-government 
approach to public sector modernization that 
promotes 
simple, 
efficient, 
and 
transparent 
government with the citizen at the center of 
reforms. The GovTech approach is at the forefront 
of supporting countries to digitally transform their 
governments to boost their effectiveness and 
improve service delivery using technologies already 
available and accessible in most countries. The 
GovTech Global Partnership has subsequently 
supported 
readiness 
assessments 
and 
new 
GovTech strategies for digital public service delivery 
in a range of countries. 
3 Independent Evaluation Group, 2020, The World’s Bank: An Evaluation of the World Bank Group’s Global Convening, p. ix. 
“The GovTech Global Partnership is 
at the forefront of advancing the use 
of government technology solutions 
for sustainable development and 
showing how we, as development 
partners, can make a difference.”

for International Financial Institutions,  
Ministry of Finance, Austria

Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships
In 2017, the World Bank played an essential role as a 
facilitator, thought leader, and convener of a broad 
group of development partners, UN agencies, and 
the private sector to create a shared vision for “good” 
ID systems in the Principles of Identification for 
Sustainable Development. Since then, through the 
Identification for Development (ID4D) Program, 
the Bank has deeply infused these principles into its 
support for civil registration and ID systems globally, 
including analytical work, technical assistance, and 
over $1.5 billion in World Bank financing. Three years 
later, the same group of stakeholders came together 
to revisit the Principles to ensure that they continue 
to reflect new realities and good practices.
IFC’s 
Global 
Cities 
Platform 
connects 
municipalities, regional governments, and the 
private sector around complex cities transformation 
initiatives and underlying development challenges. 
The platform has enabled IFC to refocus its work 
with three of Colombia’s largest cities during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. It pivoted from catalyzing 
investments in sustainable urban infrastructure to 
helping the public sector balance the need to protect 
citizens and slow the spread of the virus with a 
desire to reopen economies. In 2020, IFC supported 
the city of Bogota to define and collect data on the 
impact of the quarantine on women, which will be 
used to inform a data-driven gender-sensitive policy 
response. IFC is also preparing Advisory packages 
covering smart cities, urban mobility, waste and 
water solutions, and environmental and social 
policies, tailored to the needs of each city.
ADVANCING CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
The World Bank Group works through trust-funded 
partnerships to advance cross-cutting issues 
inherent in the global consensus underlying the 
SDGs—in these cases, advancing gender equality.
Several years ago, the Public-Private Infrastructure 
Facility (PPIAF) and IFC began a modest initiative 
to advance gender equality in public-private 
partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure in the light of 
the World Bank’s 2015–23 Gender Strategy. This 
investigation of gender equity considerations within 
PPPs culminated in the publication of a primer on 
Gender Equality, Infrastructure and PPPs in May 
2019. Today, the primer is playing a key role in moving 
PPP practitioners in development banks and client 
countries toward a more systematic integration of 
gender considerations in PPP projects.
To share and build greater knowledge among 
governments, academia, industry, and civil society 
on actions that could enhance gender equality 
in oil, gas and mining, the Extractives Global 
Programmatic Support Program (EGPS) and 
the Inter-American Development Bank jointly 
organized the Second Gender Oil, Gas and Mining 
Conference, held virtually in March 2021. The World 
Bank contributed its deep professional expertise and 
knowledge to the conference to assist participants 
in bringing about improvements in all people’s lives 
working in the sector.
PROVIDING GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS
The World Bank is one of the main and most trusted 
sources of national sustainability data and analysis. It 
fosters collaboration and partnerships by providing 
global public goods in the form of analytical toolkits 
and open-source data portals.
Since 2016, the Global Procurement Partnership 
(GPP) has supported innovative activities for 
procurement reforms at the global and country 
levels, including the Methodology for Assessing 
Procurement Systems (MAPS). This universal 
diagnostic tool for public procurement systems 
assesses 
the 
accountability, 
integrity, 
and 
transparency of the public procurement systems 
of countries or jurisdictions, including the legal, 
regulatory, and institutional frameworks and market 
practices. The partnership has subsequently funded 
the implementation of 15 MAPS assessments across 
five regions, including eight IDA countries and five 
FCV-affected countries, and supported follow-up 
action plans and reforms in some of these countries.
In early 2019, the Financial Sector Reform and 
Strengthening Initiative (FIRST), the Global 
Program on Sustainability, and several other World 
Bank trust funds joined forces to improve the 
quality of publicly available environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) data. The Sovereign ESG 
Data Portal helps investors make more informed 
decisions and direct their capital to the countries, 
companies and projects where it is needed to meet 
the SDGs and the Paris Climate Accord targets. 
Launched in October 2019, the portal is a free, 
open, and easy-to-use online platform that provides 
users with sovereign-level ESG data, for all World 
Bank countries, so that investors can better engage 
sovereign issuers on ESG criteria and policies.
RALLYING IN-COUNTRY ACTORS 
The World Bank Group can also convene country-
level partners to enable trust funding. The World 
Bank set up and activated the Tunisia Economic 
Resilience and Inclusion (TERI) Umbrella 2.0 
Program in record time in March 2021 in response 
to an urgent request from the Tunisian government 
to help put in place an end-to-end management 
and information system before the first COVID-9 
vaccines arrived in the country. The Bank mobilized 
relevant funds in a very short time period through 
an initial contribution by the United Kingdom, which 
enabled the Bank to respond to this request in a 
challenging and dynamic context. 
World Bank
“That the World Bank team was able 
to design a program and move it 
to implementation under the new 
Umbrella Trust Fund, is testament 
to the strong team and the great 
relationship they have with us and 
Government of Tunisia partners.” 
Ianto Jones, Head, Prosperity and Programmes, 
British Embassy, Tunis
“The first conference was a 
game changer for me, who 
was trained as a well-site 
geologist, and expected to just 
do administrative work behind 
the desk. I am now attending 
this second conference from 
offshore, with my work vest on, 
just to show everyone how far 
we’ve come.”

RESPONDING TO THE 
COVID-19 CRISIS
2
The World Bank Group has made available around 
$157 billion from April 2020 through June 2021, 
including from IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA, trust funds, 
and portfolio allocations. The response recognizes 
that COVID-19 is not only a health crisis, but also 
a wide-ranging socio-economic crisis that involves 
saving lives, protecting poor and vulnerable people, 
ensuring sustainable business growth and job 
creation, and strengthening policies, institutions, 
and investments (Box 2.1).
World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs are 
all contributing to the COVID-19 response 
in accordance with their particular niches. 
4 Donor Balance Account (DBAs) are administrative accounts that the Bank establishes on behalf of an individual donor agency to 
temporarily hold funds until such time as they are returned to the donor agency, transferred to another trust fund, or used for purposes 
as agreed with the donor agency. DBAs are established by donor agency, not by donor country.
Many development partners are making new 
contributions to trust funds and FIFs for these 
purposes, including channeling resources in their 
Donor Balance Accounts held by the Bank Group.4 
2.1 TRUST FUND AND FIF 
CONTRIBUTIONS
IBRD/IDA TRUST FUNDS
By the end of FY2021, IBRD/IDA trust funds had 
contributed, in whole or in part, $1.13 billion to 248 
World Bank operations that are helping countries 
respond directly to the COVID-19 crisis. About 93 
percent of commitments ($1.06 billion) has been in 
the form of trust-funded RE grants and 7 percent 
of commitments ($77 million) have been in the 
form of trust-funded BE grants. About 41 percent of 
commitments ($481 million) were disbursed by June 
30, 2021. This represents more than 10 percent of 
all trust fund disbursements during the 15 months 
between April 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021.
T
he World Bank Group has mounted 
the fastest and largest crisis response 
in its history to help developing countries 
respond and recover from the COVID-19 
crisis. This response, which also applies to 
trust funds and FIFs, is taking place across 
three stages: relief, restructuring, and 
resilient recovery. 
Pillars of the World Bank Group Response to the COVID-19 Crisis
BOX 2.1
1. Saving lives: Helping countries stop transmission, deliver health services, ensure vulnerable 
households access to medical care, and build resilience for future pandemics.
2. Protecting the poor and most vulnerable people: Supporting income and food supplies for 
the most vulnerable, as well as employment for poorer households, informal businesses, and 
microenterprises. 
3. Ensuring sustainable business growth and job creation: Providing policy and financial 
assistance to businesses and financial institutions to help companies (especially small and medium-
enterprises) preserve jobs, weather the crisis, and return to growth.
4. Strengthening policies, institutions, and investments: Helping countries prepare for a resilient 
recovery, with an emphasis on improving governance and institutions.

Chapter 2. Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis
Number of IBRD/IDA Trust Fund Activities Supporting Different Types of  
COVID-19 World Bank Operations
FIGURE 2.1
Of the 248 operations, 135 are lending projects, 
105 are ASA, and 8 are research and knowledge 
activities. The 135 lending projects were supported 
by 137 trust funds for BE activities, 65 co-financing 
trust funds for RE activities, and 26 stand-alone trust 
funds for RE activities. The 105 ASA were supported 
by 124 trust funds for BE activities and the 8 research 
and knowledge products were supported by 9 trust-
funds for BE activities (Figure 2.1).
As shown in Figure 2.2, the number of new trust-
funded BE grant commitments for the COVID-19 
response accelerated from five commitments in the 
third quarter of FY2020 (January to March 2020) to 
43 commitments in the fourth quarter (April to June 
2020), and 82 commitments in the first quarter of 
FY2021 (July to September 2020). The number of 
new trust-funded RE grant commitments peaked 
one quarter later at 26 grants during the second 
quarter of FY2021 (October to December 2020). 
Trust fund commitment amounts for both BE and 
RE activities peaked during the first quarter of 
FY2021, with BE grants at $27.4 million and RE 
grants at $297 million (Figure 2.3).
Number of COVID-19 Related Trust Fund Activities by Time Periods
FIGURE 2.2
IBRD/IDA trust funds are especially critical for 
countries that do not have access to IBRD/IDA 
financing. These include countries in arrears 
(Zimbabwe and Sudan),5 and non-members (West 
Bank and Gaza). Syrian refugees in Lebanon and 
Jordan, and Venezuelan refugees in Ecuador are 
other special cases where trust funds can provide 
vital resources because their access to IBRD or IDA 
resources is constrained. The COVID-19 pandemic 
has also exacerbated risks in FCV-affected 
countries, such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Five of the 
top 10 countries receiving trust fund support for 
COVID-19-related activities are affected by FCV and 
collectively accounted for 54 percent of total trust 
fund commitments for COVID-19 response.
For example, the Afghanistan Reconstruction 
Trust Fund (ARTF) approved five RE grants totaling 
$470 million during FY2021, alongside IDA financing 
of $420 million, to help the country respond to the 
COVID-19 crisis. This included a development policy 
grant to strengthen the policy for relief and recovery 
and four investment projects that aimed to support 
critical food supply chains, provide emergency 
support to households, improve access to and 
quality of water supplies, and strengthen national 
systems for public health preparedness.

Chapter 2. Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis
The Jordan Inclusive Growth and Economic 
Opportunities MDTF provided $24.17 million 
alongside $350 million of IBRD financing for 
the Jordan Emergency Cash Transfer COVID-19 
Response Project, which was approved in June 
2020. Like other small, open economies with strong 
links to global markets, Jordan’s real GDP contracted 
by 1.6 percent in 2020 due to profound impacts on 
key sectors of the economy, such as services, travel 
receipts, and tourism. Economic contraction and 
job loss have hit women and youth especially hard. 
The project is providing temporary cash transfers to 
270,000 poor and vulnerable households adversely 
affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.
Low-income countries have received 62 percent 
of total COVID-19-related trust fund commitments 
and lower middle-income countries have received 
25 percent. The World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) initiated a Debt Service 
Suspension Initiative (DSSI) allowing participating 
countries to temporarily suspend debt-service 
payments to their official creditors. Since its launch 
on May 1, 2020, the initiative has delivered more 
than $5 billion in relief to more than 40 countries 
who chose to participate in it, out of the 73 eligible 
countries.6 About 64 percent of total COVID-19-
related trust fund commitments have gone to 
participating DSSI countries, and another 9 percent 
to non-participating eligible countries. 
The transition of the IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio 
toward better focused, more consolidated Umbrella 
2.0 Programs is also showing results through the 
World Bank Group’s crisis response. A total of 27 
Umbrella Programs have responded to COVID-19 
with new grant-level commitments, collectively 
representing 57 percent of the total trust fund 
response of $1.13 billion as of end of FY2021. 
The remainder of the response has come in part 
from three FIF-supported programs (28 percent) for 
which the World Bank is one of the implementing 
entities—the Global Partnership for Education, the 
Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, and the 
Global Concessional Financing Facility—and from 
some other large trust-funded programs (14 percent) 
like the West Bank and Gaza MDTF. The top seven 
programs, led by the Afghanistan Reconstruction 
Trust Fund, have accounted for 84 percent of 
the grant commitments to COVID-19-related 
activities (Figure 2.4).

COVID-19 Related Trust-Funded Activities: Seven Largest Programs by  
Approved Grant Amounts
FIGURE 2.4
Overall, the umbrella framework has facilitated a 
more rapid response than might otherwise have 
been the case. Some programs have streamlined 
grant-making processes to make crisis recovery 
funds available to implementing partners as quickly 
as possible. They have also pivoted existing grants 
to address clients’ most immediate needs. These 
adjustments have enabled programs to free up 
resources to support their COVID-19 responses and 
deliver on the most pressing priorities. 
For example, the Global Facility for Disaster 
Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) has adapted 
existing engagements to help countries manage 
the pandemic. It is supporting the development 
of emergency preparedness plans and response 
protocols, identifying and repurposing public 
facilities, and scaling approaches that link disaster 
risk management preparedness and response 
systems to health emergencies. Going forward, 
GFDRR will work with partners to support 
communities and countries to meet the dual 
challenge of managing natural hazard risks, while 
mobilizing the disaster risk management community 
to address the impacts of the pandemic.
The Human Rights, Inclusion and Empowerment 
(HRIE) 
program 
has 
also 
adjusted 
grant 
implementation to make up for cancelled or 
postponed on-the-ground activities, such as 
primary data collection, engagement with local 
governments and CSOs, and field visits to supervise 
implementation. 
Working 
with 
governments 
and CSOs, teams have shifted gears to continue 
reaching out to marginalized populations. An 
e-learning program was developed in lieu of in-
person training, enabling teams to reach much 
broader audiences than previously anticipated.
The Debt Management Facility (DMF) has 
also changed its way of doing business to meet 
client country needs. Instead of traveling to client 
countries to provide technical assistance, it has 
adapted to remote delivery. It has also prioritized the 
development of new Massive Online Open Courses 
(MOOCs) offering self-paced learning opportunities, 
as well as adapting other training and learning 
opportunities to a virtual format. 
From a thematic perspective, five World Bank 
Global Practices collectively account for 87 percent 
of the IBRD/IDA trust fund response to COVID-19, 
starting with the Health, Nutrition and Population 
Global Practice at 28 percent (Figure 2.5). These 
show that the Bank’s COVID-19 response addresses 
not just the health crisis, but also the wider socio-
economic crisis.

Chapter 2. Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis
IFC TRUST FUNDS
The private sector’s role in development has 
never been more important than it is now, as the 
world works to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. 
Governments around the world have reallocated 
resources to combat the spread of COVID-19, 
making limited public resources scarcer and 
highlighting the importance of catalyzing private 
sector investments. 
IFC is helping countries weather the devastating 
economic impacts of COVID-19 and build a more 
sustainable, inclusive, and resilient future with the 
support of the private sector. With insolvencies 
looming across the developing world, IFC is working 
to preserve the private sector, rebuild economies, 
and work upstream to create projects that will 
attract investment back into developing countries. 
IFC’s goal is also to help restructure and recapitalize 
viable financial institutions and companies on their 
path to recovery, as well as alleviate bottlenecks in 
critical supply sectors such as health care. 
For example, IFC has launched a $4 billion Global 
Health Platform aimed at boosting the production 
and supply of critical COVID-19 health care products 
in developing countries. The initiative, supported by 
development partners, is focusing on manufacturing 
products, such as personal protective equipment, 
ventilators and other medical equipment, COVID-19 
test kits, therapeutic drugs, and vaccines. 
Strong emphasis is being placed on supporting 
clients operating in low-income and FCV-affected 
countries. To attract foreign direct investment 
into these more challenging locations, IFC is also 
leveraging concessional financing from trust funds.
As IFC works to help countries build a resilient 
recovery, trust funds will be important contributors. 
IFC aims to accelerate the expansion of upstream 
activities with the goal of building back better and 
delivering interventions that meet the short-term 
needs but also maintain a line of sight on longer-
term 
development 
challenges. 
Development 
partner support through trust funds will be needed 
to develop projects quickly, build capacity, and 
support delivery, as well as to mitigate risks and 
encourage the private sector to invest.
IFC is also working with the World Bank to ensure 
that countries have policies and regulations in place 
to resolve distressed assets, and that companies’ 
underlying operations are restructured to be viable 
to support growth and sustain employment. 
IFC has adapted its delivery modes in response to 
COVID-19. It has overcome travel restrictions by 
moving to virtual outreach and delivery platforms, 
including piloting innovative approaches such as 
virtual reality assessments. The focus on virtual 
and remote consultation has spurred clients to 
adopt digital solutions that will facilitate future 
engagement.
FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY FUNDS 
The global initiatives supported by FIFs have 
provided much needed leadership and support 
in providing immediate relief to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Four health-related FIFs have played 
leading roles in COVID-19 vaccine research and 
development, preparedness and response: the 
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations 
(CEPI), 
International 
Finance 
Facility 
for 
Immunisation (IFFIm), the Global Fund to Fight 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), and 
the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF). 
In addition, the Advanced Market Commitment 
(AMC) for Pneumococcal Vaccines has served as 
a model for establishing the COVID-19 Vaccines 
Global Access (COVAX) AMC, which is creating 
market-based incentives to support more equitable, 
world-wide access to COVID vaccines.
Established in 2018, CEPI was one of the first 
organizations to start investing in the development 
of COVID-19 vaccines. Prior to the COVID-19 
pandemic, CEPI had allocated over $140 million to 
develop vaccines against MERS, a virus related to 
SARS-CoV-2. During 2020, CEPI was able to pivot 
most of its MERS and platform technology partners 
to work on COVID-19 and rapidly built up a portfolio 
of 11 vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. By the end of year, 
two of these vaccines had demonstrated high 
efficacy in preventing severe COVID-19 disease 
and had received emergency use authorizations, 
enabling roll out of vaccine doses in early 2021. 
Not only has CEPI invested in one of the world’s 
largest portfolio of vaccines against COVID-19, 
it has also awarded forgivable loans to expand 
global manufacturing capacity and established 
a global network of laboratories to standardize 
vaccine assessment.
Established in 2006, IFFIm issues Vaccine Bonds 
in capital markets, backed by binding pledges from 
donor countries, which provide immediate funding 
for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to purchase and 
distribute vaccines. With the World Bank serving 
as Treasury Manager, IFFIm has played a critical 
role in frontloading donor pledges to support the 
international community’s response to COVID-19 
pandemic. During 2020, IFFIm provided $272 
million to Gavi for use by CEPI to develop COVID-19 
vaccines. Then in January 2021, IFFIm provided a 
first tranche of $400 million to Gavi for COVAX AMC 
to fund the purchase of vaccines for 92 of the world’s 
poorest countries, and an additional $380 million for 
COVAX AMC as of June 30, 2021. The Vaccine Bonds 
issued by IFFIm to support these disbursements 
have included the first-ever Norwegian Kroner-
denominated bonds in July 2020 and the second 
largest issuance of $750 million in April 2021.
Established in 2002, the Global Fund also 
responded quickly and decisively to the COVID-19 
crisis, by approving up to $1 billion in April 2020 
to help countries respond to the pandemic; adapt 
their HIV, TB and malaria programs; and reinforce 
their 
already 
overstretched 
health 
systems. 
Through its COVID-19 Response Mechanism, 
the Global Fund has become the primary grant 
support to low- and middle-income counties for 
obtaining COVID-19 tests, treatments, and personal 
protective equipment. The Global Fund is also a 
founding partner of the Access to COVID-19 Tools 
Accelerator (ACT-Accelerator) and co-leads two 
of the ACT-Accelerator’s four components: the 
Diagnostics Pillar and Health Systems Connector. 
This global collaboration of leading public health 
agencies is working with governments, civil society 
and industry to accelerate the development and 
equitable distribution of tests, treatments, and 
vaccines and to strengthen health systems.
Until it closed in April 2021, PEF was a fast- 
disbursing financing mechanism to provide surge 
funding to IDA-eligible countries in the case of major 
multi-country disease outbreaks like COVID-19. 
Its Cash Window, which has been supported by 
traditional donor contributions into a trust fund, 
had paid out $61.4 million to support the front-
line response to Ebola in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo in 2018 and 2019. On March 31, 2020, 
conditions for a payout from the PEF Insurance 
Window were met, releasing the maximum 
coverage of $195.84 million to support the COVID-19 
pandemic response in IDA countries. The PEF 
Steering Body allocated the whole amount to 64 of 
the world’s poorest countries with reported cases 
of COVID-19, with special attention given to areas 
with the most vulnerable populations, especially in 
FCV-affected countries. By September 30, 2020, 
the entire insurance payout had been transferred to 
support COVID-19 responses, with the World Bank 
serving as one of the main implementing entities for 
PEF grants.
Other FIF-supported programs in agriculture, 
education, the environment, and infrastructure 
have also addressed some of the immediate socio-
economic effects of the crisis. They have been fully 
engaged in addressing the question of how the 
world can end the pandemic and emerge stronger, 
more united, more equitable, and more prepared for 
future known threats. (Section 3.3.)

Chapter 2. Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis
2.2 STORIES FROM THE FIELD
Trust-funded programs are contributing to the World 
Bank Group’s COVID-19 response by supporting 
efforts to save lives, protect poor and vulnerable 
people, ensure sustainable business growth and job 
creation, and strengthen policies, institutions, and 
investments. Many of these activities are detailed in 
the 2021 Yearbook of Trust-funded Results. 
SAVING LIVES
The Global Financing Facility (GFF) and the 
Health Emergency Preparedness and Response 
Fund (HEPR) are leading the IBRD/IDA trust funds’ 
contribution to mitigating COVID-19 transmission, 
delivering health services, ensuring that vulnerable 
households have access to medical care, and 
building resilience for future pandemics. The 
Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) was 
also an important contributor until its closure in 
April 2021 (Figure 2.4). 
The GFF has played a complementary role to 
the World Bank’s efforts to finance the purchase 
and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, tests, and 
treatments. Its COVID-19 Essential Health Services 
grants have enabled partner countries to prioritize 
and strengthen primary care and community-based 
services, capacities, and the health workforce that 
are critical for the equitable and effective delivery of 
both COVID-19 tools and essential health services. 
The GFF is helping to ensure that as countries 
recover and build their next generation health 
systems, they prioritize access to quality, affordable 
care for women, children, and adolescents.
The World Bank set up the HEPR Umbrella Program 
in 2020 to complement regular IBRD/IDA resources. 
It provides upstream and catalytic funding to 
help countries prepare for and rapidly respond to 
emerging health emergencies, even when they occur 
outside their borders. By the end of FY2021, HEPR 
had secured over $175 million in donor contributions, 
and allocated nearly $117 million to 24 countries and 
regional efforts, with 59 percent of grant allocations 
to address the COVID-19 pandemic and 41 percent 
to prepare better for future health emergencies. 
Many of these grants have been processed as co-
financing to new or existing World Bank projects 
that focus on health emergency preparedness and 
the client countries’ COVID-19 responses.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted 
the critical need for electricity to save lives. The 
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program 
(ESMAP) has developed a strong collaboration with 
the World Bank’s Health Global Practice and its 
global partners to rapidly deliver a climate-informed 
COVID-19 response. It is focusing on electrification 
of health facilities with renewable energy and 
sustainable operational models and on deployment 
of reliable and climate-smart cold chains to deliver 
vaccines. In Haiti, for example, ESMAP is supporting 
efforts to install solar hybrid electricity systems 
for prioritized health care and water facilities. 
Approximately 1 million people are expected to gain 
improved access to health services and clean water 
as a result. 
PROTECTING THE POOR AND  
MOST VULNERABLE
Trust funds are also supporting World Bank Group’s 
efforts to protect incomes and food supplies for 
the most vulnerable, as well as employment for 
poorer households, informal businesses, and 
microenterprises impacted by the pandemic. 
Leading the trust fund contribution to mitigating 
both the immediate and long-term disruptions to 
education is the Global Partnership for Education 
(GPE), a FIF for which the World Bank is an 
implementing entity. This includes more than $175 
million in World Bank-supervised RE grants to help 
children in recipient countries to continue to access 
learning opportunities, with a focus on girls and 
poor children, who have been the hardest hit by 
school closures. 
The Rapid Social Response–Adaptive and 
Dynamic Social Protection (RSR–ADSP) Umbrella 
Program issued its latest call for grant proposals 
in early FY2021 to address gender-specific and 
differentiated concerns as part of social protection 
Orlando Barría / World Bank
and safety net responses to the pandemic. This call 
focused on systems to help households cope with 
income and job loss, ensure continued access to 
social and human capital services, and address 
the disproportionate socio-economic impact of the 
virus on women and girls. 
PROBLUE has prioritized activities supporting 
fishing communities that have been adversely 
impacted by the pandemic, as well as new activities 
around water and sanitation issues in the fisheries 
value chain.
The Extractives Global Programmatic Support 
(EGPS) Umbrella Program has established a $5.2 
million emergency response facility to provide 
short-term assistance to a range of international, 
regional, 
and 
local 
organizations 
providing 
relief to artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) 
communities. The COVID-19 pandemic threatened 
to reverse the enormous progress that ASM 
communities have made to formalize the sector. 
Similar to informal workers worldwide, ASM 
communities are disproportionally vulnerable to the 
COVID-19 crisis due to poor health care, precarious 
working conditions, high incidence of respiratory 
diseases, and exposure of vulnerable groups in an 
environment of limited government oversight.
“Some of the poorest and most 
vulnerable people work in artisanal and 
small-scale mining, and we are deeply 
concerned by the effects of COVID-19 
on their lives and livelihoods. EGPS is 
well-placed to provide significant and 
concerted support.”
Monica Rubiolo, Head of Trade Promotion,  
Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs

Chapter 2. Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis
SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE 
BUSINESS GROWTH AND JOBS
World Bank Group trust funds are providing policy 
and financial assistance to governments, businesses, 
and financial institutions to help companies, 
especially small and medium-enterprises (SMEs), 
preserve jobs, weather the crisis, and return 
to growth.
The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor 
(CGAP) has provided guidance to microfinance 
institutions on navigating the COVID-19 crisis and 
improving their resilience to future shocks, and to 
governments on improving government-to-person 
payment (G2P) systems. The World Bank and CGAP 
have helped accelerate policy reforms in countries 
that had not yet invested in digital systems and 
were struggling to distribute relief payments. CGAP 
support to Ecuador, Indonesia, Lebanon, Pakistan, 
the Philippines, Sudan, and Zambia, among others, 
has resulted in reforms being implemented in a few 
months that would normally take years.
COVID-19 was impacting women differently than 
men. In response, the SheWorks companies came 
together for a series of webinars to share lessons 
learned about how to support employees, especially 
women, during the pandemic. They reported that the 
family-friendly policy frameworks, like flex-work and 
remote working that had been put in place due to 
SheWorks, enabled them to seamlessly transition to 
work from home during lock downs. This COVID-19 
study has led to two new IFC projects in Sri Lanka 
focusing on SME capacity building and COVID-19 
impacts on employment.
have the most significant impact on health. Each 
of its the major work streams, but particularly 
Environmental Health, Air Quality Management, 
and Circular Economy, will have strong links to the 
COVID-19 pandemic in terms of analytical work, 
addressing connections between air pollution and 
COVID-19 outcomes. 
PROBLUE is also contributing to a clean recovery 
through its focus on marine pollution prevention, 
for example, by assessing the impacts of single-
use plastics use in health care facilities and by 
developing health care waste management plans in 
cities along rivers and in coastal areas. 
STRENGTHENING POLICIES, 
INSTITUTIONS, AND INVESTMENTS
Trust-funded activities are also helping countries 
prepare for a resilient recovery, with an emphasis on 
improving governance and institutions. The Global 
Tax Program (GTP) Umbrella Program responded to 
the COVID-19 crisis by providing countries with just-
in-time fiscal policy advice on developing effective, 
efficient, and balanced fiscal policy responses. 
This has included macro-fiscal policy, domestic 
resource mobilization, expenditure policy, and fiscal 
risk management, plus important cross-cutting 
themes, such as poverty and distributional impact, 
transparency, and accountability. An additional 
$5.4 million in donor contributions is supporting 
GTP efforts on long-term fiscal sustainability 
and resilience. 
In 2020, IFC signed its first national-level agreement 
with the Federal Government of Somalia to 
provide a road map for the development of the of 
the nascent private sector. It was part of ongoing 
legal and regulatory Advisory work supported by 
two Somalia Private Sector Development trust 
funds. IFC collaborated with partners to conduct 
a survey of businesses across the country to help 
the government assess the impact of COVID-19. 
Although the initial impact was devastating—90 
percent of firms experienced decreased liquidity 
and cash flow—the survey found that companies 
were optimistic for the future. IFC’s work in Somalia 
“CGAP’s work on G2P payments 
organically built on ongoing project 
work and catalyzed policy reforms. 
It looked to apply lessons from India 
to countries such as the Philippines 
and Peru.”
Comments from a confidential evaluation  
of CGAP’s COVID-19 response
“The business organizations 
participating in SheWorks 
have provided the proof that 
commitment to gender diversity 
is good for their businesses.”
H.E. David Holly, Australian High Commissioner 
to Sri Lanka and the Maldives
aims to build on this optimism, and ensure that, 
moving forward, companies have the institutional 
framework to help support them to fully recover and 
operate their businesses sustainably.
Since 2017, IFC’s SheWorks Sri Lanka Partnership, 
supported by the DFAT-IFC Global Advisory 
Services Trust Fund, has worked with 15 leading 
employers across different industries to help identify 
and implement gender-smart business solutions 
to boost women’s participation and business 
productivity. Twelve of these companies participated 
in a 2020 IFC survey in Sri Lanka that demonstrated 
The pandemic has also highlighted the critical 
need for water to not only prevent the spread 
of the disease, but also to revitalize economies, 
employment opportunities, health outcomes, and 
the environment. The Global Water Security and 
Sanitation Program (GWSP) has utilized the 
umbrella approach to quickly provide resources 
across its various business lines to tackle emerging 
needs, while also preserving long-term engagements 
on the ground. Sustaining the gains of the past and 
putting countries back on track to achieve SDG 6 
(clean water and sanitation) are fundamental to a 
resilient and sustainable recovery and will remain a 
focus for GWSP in the medium to long term.
As governments turn their attention to economic 
recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, there are 
new opportunities to embrace green, resilient, 
and inclusive recovery programs to achieve more 
growth with lower pollution. PROCLEAN activities 
will help tackle the environmental problems that 
To help governments navigate the impacts of 
COVID-19 on their PPPs for infrastructure projects, 
the 
Public-Private 
Infrastructure 
Advisory 
Facility (PPIAF) and the World Bank have launched 
a COVID-19 PPP Rapid Response Program. It 
conducts rapid assessments of countries’ portfolios 
to identify fiscal, financial, and social risks; estimate 
their costs; and inform decision-makers on options 
and actions. The program has brought global 
financial, fiscal, technical, and legal expertise to 
eight countries and one regional engagement 
during its first year of operation, including Peru and 
the Philippines.
“PPIAF provided us deeper 
understanding of PPP fiscal impacts 
and best practices for managing them.” 
Ferdinand A. Pecson, Executive Director  
of the Public-Private Partnership Center  
of the Philippines
“IFC’s advisory support will help 
Somalia tackle bottlenecks in the 
business environment and enable us 
to attract more investment from both 
domestic sources and the Somali 
diaspora, which is a national priority.”

T
he World Bank Group’s COVID-19 crisis 
response has provided an opportunity 
to support a strong, durable recovery that 
tackles rising poverty and deepening 
inequality while addressing the longer-
term challenge of climate change. 
The Bank Group’s green, resilient, and inclusive 
development approach, or GRID, calls for  scaling up 
investments in all forms of capital—human, physical, 
natural, and social—to drive growth, create jobs, 
and contribute to a better future for all, especially 
vulnerable, low-income populations. Integrated, 
longer-horizon GRID strategies can repair the 
structural damage caused by COVID-19 and 
accelerate climate action while restoring momentum 
on poverty reduction and shared prosperity. 
The World Bank Group is well positioned to help 
countries with the challenges ahead through 
its convening power, global reach, and capacity 
to mobilize finance, technical assistance, and 
knowledge for both the public and private sectors 
and in cooperation with its development partners. 
This clear line of sight forward points to progress 
already being made to strengthen resilience across 
systems and society. 
Looking back over the last five years, trust funds 
and FIFs have supported World Bank Group 
public and private sector efforts in health, climate 
action, gender, social protection and jobs, and debt 
management—all essential building blocks for 
greater resilience and key development priorities 
of client countries. Not only do these themes align 
with the GRID approach, but they also reveal the 
diversity and strategic value of trust-funded activities 
already underway. 
As shown in Table 3.1, social protection and jobs has 
received more than 42 percent of IBRD/IDA trust 
fund support to these five themes during the last five 
years, followed by health (28 percent) and climate 
action (24 percent). About 68 percent of FIF support 
has been for health and 31 percent for climate 
action. Together with IFC’s ongoing work with the 
private sector, this represents a strong foundation 
for greater resilience now and into the future. 
The following activities, which are expanded in the 
2021 Yearbook of Trust-funded Results, demonstrate 
how World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs 
advance countries’ development priorities and help 
build greater resilience.

Chapter 3. Building Resilience Now and Into the Future
Ensuring that every man, woman, and child has 
access to health care is fundamental to ending 
poverty and building robust economies. The 
pandemic has disrupted delivery of essential health 
services, particularly in the poorest nations with the 
most fragile health systems, threatening to reverse 
years of hard-won gains in health and human capital 
outcomes. Now more than ever there is a need to 
strengthen national health systems’ preparedness 
and capacities and ensure continuity of essential 
health services. 
In addition to health interventions related to 
COVID-19 (Section 2.2), ongoing health sector 
investments and research within the World Bank 
are focused on building resilient health systems, 
with trust funds playing an integral role. 
For example, the Global Financing Facility for 
Women, Children and Adolescents (GFF) is 
supporting the World Bank’s Liberia Health System 
Strengthening Project to improve service delivery 
and health outcomes for women and children. 
This work had contributed to 24 percent more 
assisted deliveries and 20 percent more children 
being immunized in six at-risk counties, but these 
gains were jeopardized when COVID-19 disrupted 
delivery of essential services. The GFF quickly 
adapted its grant funding to focus on strengthening 
community health channels and addressing low 
service demand. Funding helped modify the delivery 
of routine health services for COVID-19, increase the 
capacity of frontline health care workers, and adapt 
existing programming to address emergency needs.
The GFF has also worked alongside the World Bank 
and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund 
(ARTF) on the Sehatmandi Project to improve 
the delivery and quality of health, nutrition, and 
family planning services in 34 provinces across 
Afghanistan. By the end of FY2021, a first-ever 
resource mapping and expenditure tracking exercise 
had helped to assess the impact of investments on 
the quality of basic health services. 
A new performance-based system was also 
introduced to better manage service provider 
contracts and link payment to performance 
in delivering 11 key health services, including 
immunization, skilled birth attendance, family 
planning visits, and growth monitoring of children. 
The volume of services delivered under the project 
increased for 10 out of 11 payment indicators. For 
example, between 2018 and 2019, the number of 
couple-years of contraceptive protection provided 
by Sehatmandi facilities increased by 49 percent 
and the number of women giving birth at a health 
facility increased by 21 percent.

CAMBODIA: PRO-POOR 
APPROACH TO QUALITY  
HEALTH SERVICES
The Cambodia Health Equity and Quality 
Improvement Program (H-EQIP) MDTF supports 
a program of the same name that is helping the 
Cambodian government improve nationwide access 
to better quality, affordable health services. Despite 
dramatic reductions in poverty and improved health 
outcomes (especially in maternal and child health), 
socio-economic and rural-urban health inequalities 
persist in Cambodia. About one quarter of the 
population remains vulnerable to small economic 
shocks, and out-of-pocket expenditures on health 
care are around 60 percent—one of the highest 
rates in the world. 
To improve service quality and help poor households 
overcome the cost barrier, H-EQIP helped launch 
service delivery grants, which are regular payments 
to health facilities based on performance, and 
health equity funds (HEFs), which purchase health 
services on behalf of registered households so that 
they can access care free of charge. 
These platforms are now predominantly funded by 
the government, and strong national ownership 
is assured by the Payment Certification Agency 
(PCA), an independent public entity that verifies 
reimbursements to health facilities. The PCA 
provides a cost-efficient and sustainable mechanism 
for managing the HEF system and is well placed to a 
play a central role as Cambodia progresses toward 
universal health coverage.
Service delivery grants now flow to all health facilities 
on time, and the PCA is fully staffed and operational. 
HEFs operate at all public health facilities in the 
country, and H-EQIP performance monitoring tools 
were digitized in 2019 to ease tracking of service 
quality. These and other measures have helped to 
reduce the proportion of households vulnerable 
to high health care costs by 43 percent from 
2015 to 2020.
An important moment for H-EQIP came in 2020 
when 
its 
Contingent 
Emergency 
Response 
Component (CERC) was activated. This enabled 
immediate mobilization of $14 million for Cambodia’s 
COVID-19 response without interrupting continuity 
in the delivery of core health services.

Chapter 3. Building Resilience Now and Into the Future
The threat of climate change remains critical for 
countries, forcing people to evacuate homes, grapple 
with food insecurity, or the impacts of deforestation 
and biodiversity loss, even as they also deal with 
the health and economic impacts of the pandemic. 
Left unchecked, climate change will push 132 million 
people into poverty over the next 10 years, undoing 
hard-won development gains. 
The World Bank Group is the largest multilateral 
provider of climate finance for developing countries, 
and it is focused on increasing climate ambition 
and action around the world. Ongoing trust-
funded activities are not only helping countries 
cope with climate vulnerabilities that threaten their 
ongoing development, but also helping them stay 
competitive as the global economy moves toward a 
net-zero future.
For example, the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection 
Program (SASSP) is supporting adaptive social 
protection programs in six Sahelian countries. The 
combination of cash transfers and assistance is 
helping poor and vulnerable households become 
more resilient to shocks and stresses, particularly 
the impacts of climate change. The program has 
helped pilot an early drought response mechanism 
that uses satellite data to trigger rapid-response 
cash transfers to at-risk households in Mauritania 
and Niger.
The Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance 
Facility (SEADRIF) is a first-of-its-kind facility in 
Asia that leverages financial markets to provide 
member countries with technical and financial 
solutions for better protection against disaster 
shocks in the face of climate risks. The first insurance 
product, a regional catastrophe risk pool launched in 
2021, is underpinned by the first regional near-real-
time flood monitoring platform and risk model. This 
enables governments to make better risk-informed 
decisions before, during, and in the aftermath 
of flooding.
The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility 
(PPIAF) is helping to expand African markets 
for pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) solar, a fast-growing 
business model for off-grid lighting and electricity 
solutions. Together with IFC, PPIAF created the 
PAYGO Market Attractiveness Index, which PAYGO 
operators are using to assess demand, supply, and 
enabling factors at a country-by-country level. 
Policymakers can also use it to identify gaps and 
opportunities for policy interventions and reforms. 
Trust funds are also financing research and 
knowledge tools to support greater climate 
resilience and low-carbon growth. The Climate 
Support Facility (CSF) helped Ethiopia assess 
its Climate Resilient Green Economy Strategy for 
mainstreaming into national development plans, 
as well as updating its Nationally Determined 
Contribution ahead of COP26 in November 2021. 
In the small island nation of Tuvalu, a study funded by 
the Quality Infrastructure Investment Partnership 
(QIIP) provided technical specifications and 
engineering solutions to fix the runway at the 
Funafuti International Airport, which had failed due 
to moisture build-up exacerbated by sea level rise, 
increased rainfall, and larger waves. 
CLIMATE ACTION 
COLOMBIA: FOSTERING 
RESILIENCE AND LOW-CARBON 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE AMAZON
Since 
2015, 
the 
Forest 
Conservation 
and 
Sustainability in the Heart of the Colombian 
Amazon Project has played a critical role in reducing 
deforestation, conserving biodiversity, and fostering 
climate resilience in the Amazon. It represents long-
term commitment and cooperation among donors, 
the government, and community organizations, 
with co-financing from government resources, 
bilateral cooperation agencies, and three rounds of 
FIF funding from the Global Environment Facility 
(GEF) implemented by the World Bank, the most 
recent of which was approved in 2021. 
Investments 
are 
helping 
to 
strengthen 
the 
management of protected areas—including the 
Serranía de Chiribiquete National Park, the world’s 
largest national tropical rainforest protected area 
at 4.3 million hectares—and assisting national 
and subnational public institutions to mainstream 
environmental criteria into different areas of 
agriculture, mining, infrastructure, and land-use 
planning. Colombia’s forest and carbon monitoring 
systems are also being supported. 
The project is also enhancing the capacity of 
Indigenous and rural communities to undertake 
sustainable landscape management practices. 
Participatory 
community 
land-use 
planning 
processes have led to increased ecosystem 
connectivity and strengthened climate resilience 
in target areas. To date, rural households have 
signed 558 conservation agreements to preserve 
standing forests, restore degraded areas, and 
develop agroforestry activities on over 48,000 
hectares, conserving more than 40 percent of their 
farmland. In parallel, the government and research 
institutions are helping rural communities increase 
incomes and food security through climate-
smart livelihood alternatives that also strengthen 
low-carbon development and restore productive 
natural resources. 
The local planning approach has proven so 
successful that the government has expanded it to 
reach 12,000 households in the Amazon region as 
outlined in the National Development Plan. Newly 
approved GEF financing will help scale up efforts to 
strengthen management and financial sustainability 
of additional protected areas, and it will build on 
the results of local community agreements to 
expand the area under sustainable community 
forestry practices.

“Community agreements are important 
not only for the forest and preventing 
deforestation, but also for the future 
of our children, community, and 
generations to come.”

Chapter 3. Building Resilience Now and Into the Future
The 
pandemic 
has 
exposed 
existing 
social 
and economic inequities even more glaringly. 
Lockdowns, 
school 
closures, 
and 
economic 
downturn have disproportionately impacted the 
education, employment, and domestic lives of 
women and girls. The World Bank Group recognizes 
that major challenges like pandemics affect people 
differentially, often to the detriment of women and 
girls due to discriminatory laws and policies, as 
well as ingrained gender and social norms. It also 
recognizes that no country, community, or economy 
can achieve its potential without the full and equal 
participation of all its people. 
The World Bank Group is working to narrow gender 
gaps and elevate women as agents of economic 
growth, stability, and sustainability. Trust funds are 
helping to accelerate progress on human capital, 
increase women’s access to good jobs and asset 
ownership, and amplify women’s voice and agency. 
For example, the State and Peace Building Fund 
(SPF) helped pilot the Integrated Platform for 
Gender-based Violence Prevention and Response 
in four districts of Nepal back in 2016 to raise 
awareness about gender-based violence and 
improve services for survivors. A 24-hour toll-free 
helpline was launched to link survivors with shelter, 
psychosocial support, legal aid, and child support 
services provided by CSOs. The National Women 
Commission has since taken ownership of the 
project and expanded services nationwide, with the 
helpline providing nearly 13,500 integrated services 
to over 21,000 clients. 
The Competitive Industries and Innovation 
Program (CIIP) financed studies on building greater 
resilience and inclusion in the fisheries sector in 
Mauritania’s Nouadhibou Free Zone, a major hub for 
fresh fish exports. The goal is to connect small-scale 
fishermen and informal processors and traders 
(generally women) to the value chain. Both the 
government and the private sector are focused on 
building women’s entrepreneurship and other skills 
in this artisanal processing sector. 
World Bank Group-implemented funding from the 
Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) 
and the Doing Business Pakistan Project supported 
a partnership between the Government of Pakistan 
and the World Bank Group’s Women, Business 
and the Law Advisory Program that informed an 
amendment to Pakistan’s Companies Act. Passed 
in 2020, the amendment lifts the requirement for 
women entrepreneurs to provide the name of their 
father or husband during the company incorporation 
process. Through the We-Fi program, IFC and the 
World Bank are also working to catalyze outreach 
and 
investments 
in 
early-stage, 
high-impact 
technology start-ups led by women in Pakistan.
The InfoDev MDTF helped the World Bank and the 
Kenyan government assess business incubators 
and accelerators within the country to identify 
ways of better supporting women in technology 
and to inform the design of the Kenya Industry and 
Entrepreneurship Project. Consultations garnered 
feedback from potential women beneficiaries, 
including entrepreneurs, students, and small 
business owners. This research continues to 
contribute to a better understanding of women 
in Kenya’s business landscape, and offers a 
foundation for future gender-focused interventions 
in the country. 
GENDER
EAST AFRICA: MAKING MOBILE 
MONEY MORE ACCESSIBLE TO 
WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE 
Agriculture is the largest source of employment 
for women in developing countries, with women 
representing more than 60 percent of the agricultural 
labor force in some parts of Asia and Africa. Yet, 
women farmers have significantly less access to 
productive assets, including financial services. 
Digital financial services, accessed largely through 
mobile devices, have expanded the availability 
of financial products to smallholder farmers and 
represent a safe and convenient way to save, obtain 
loans, and make or receive payments. However, 
in low- and middle-income countries, women are 
36 percent less likely than men to own mobile 
money accounts. 
The Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality 
(UFGE) is supporting efforts to promote greater 
financial inclusion. It funded an assessment, 
Mobile Technologies and Digitized Data to Promote 
Access to Finance for Women in Agriculture, and 
follow-on technical assistance to help three digital 
financial service providers better understand 
the needs of women farmers and develop more 
targeted financial products and marketing. Lessons 
learned and recommendations from the three pilot 
programs were consolidated and captured in a 
2021 report, Women in Agriculture: Using Digital 
Financial Services. 
Fenix (now Engie Energy Access), an off-grid solar 
home system provider in Uganda, invested in new 
tools to better gather feedback from its women 
clients. It has since adapted the tools for other 
markets and is using them in countries like Benin. 
Safaricom’s Digifarm, a digital platform that offers 
financial and non-financial services to smallholder 
farmers in Kenya, partnered with a commercial 
bank to offer savings products better tailored to the 
financial needs of women involved in agriculture. It 
also engaged with women’s groups to build trust 
and understanding of financial products. Women 
now account for 48 percent of clients for multiple 
Digifarm products, a 10 to 15 percent increase since 
technical assistance began. 
MyAgro, a social enterprise that offers bundled 
services to farmers in Tanzania, also adopted new 
marketing mechanisms. It engaged influential 
women in leadership to encourage others to enroll 
in programs, and created marketing products with 
images and terminology familiar to local women 
involved in agriculture. MyAgro also made services 
more accessible by reducing the minimum package 
size and associated prices.

The Sudan Transition and Recovery Support 
(STARS) program, an umbrella coordination platform 
for World Bank engagement in Sudan, is supporting 
the economic and peacebuilding transition after the 
collapse of the former regime in November 2019. 
As part of a larger sustainable livelihoods project, 
STARS provided technical support and financing to 
promote youth entrepreneurship. Over 1,000 young 
people, 70 percent of whom were women, received 
technical and vocational skills training, while another 
1,400 women received home cultivation training. 
The project also established a permanent incubator, 
the Inventors Development Center, to nurture and 
train young Sudanese entrepreneurs and creators 
in areas like medicine, engineering, electronics, and 
information technology.
When the Eurozone crisis struck in late 2019, Greece 
lacked a well-targeted welfare system to support 
the most vulnerable. Through the Europe2020 
Programmatic Trust Fund financed by the 
European Commission, the World Bank brought 
critical global knowledge to the task of implementing 
new social safety net programs and provided 
hands-on support for a new social solidarity income 
program. By June 2019, the program had reached 
approximately 650,000 people (6.5 percent of the 
population). This work in Greece has led to similar 
reimbursable advisory services in Italy and has 
generated approaches applied in Russia, Argentina, 
Turkey, and a globally available and applied toolkit 
for practitioners.
SOCIAL PROTECTION & JOBS
Social protection programs are at the heart of 
boosting human capital for the world’s most 
vulnerable. Not only can they cushion the impact 
of crises like COVID-19, but at any time, they 
can empower people to be healthy, pursue their 
education, and seek opportunity to lift themselves 
and their families out of poverty. Social protection 
systems that are well-designed and implemented 
can enhance human capital and productivity, 
reduce inequalities, build resilience, and end inter-
generational cycles of poverty. 
Funding from trust funds is helping the World Bank to 
expand successful programs, pilot new approaches, 
and build the evidence base on what works and 
what does not in policies and programs for social 
safety nets and sustainable social insurance.
For example, the Identification for Development 
Initiative (ID4D) brought together a multi-sectoral 
team from across the World Bank to support the 
Government of the Philippines in developing its 
new national Philippine Identification System 
(PhilSys). Proof of identity is the key to accessing 
social and financial services, and those who lacked 
proper documentation can be locked out. PhilSys 
aims to register more than 90 million Filipinos and 
accelerate the country’s transition to an inclusive and 
resilient digital economy, society, and government. 
Integrating best practices for inclusion, data privacy, 
and digital security, ID4D also helped adapt the 
registration approach for COVID-19 to prioritize 
low-income households that would benefit most 
from a digital ID to access social protection and 
financial services.
ZAMBIA: PUTTING CASH IN  
THE HANDS OF THE POOR 
CHANGES LIVES
The objective of the Girls’ Education and Women’s 
Empowerment and Livelihood (GEWEL) MDTF is 
to support the Government of Zambia in improving 
the effectiveness of its social protection system. 
Working through the GEWEL project, the trust fund 
helps increase women’s access to livelihood support 
and make secondary education more accessible to 
disadvantaged adolescent girls in extremely poor 
households in selected districts. It also supports 
cash transfers for poor and vulnerable households 
through the Social Cash Transfer (SCT) Program.
Bi-monthly SCT payments are helping families pay 
for school fees, cover medical and food expenses, 
and invest in small-scale businesses to boost 
incomes. To expand the program, the Zambian 
government secured funding from the World Bank 
and other partners through the GEWEL MDTF. 
In November 2020, payments began to flow to 
over 370,000 beneficiaries in 67 districts across the 
country prioritized based on poverty rates and size 
of SCT caseloads, among other factors. Additional 
World Bank financing will expand coverage to a 
total of 750,000 households in 2021 and 994,000 
households by 2022. This support will enable timely 
and predictable disbursements of cash transfers 
to 30 percent of the Zambian population and 50 
percent of the poor by 2022. 
A 2019 impact evaluation showed that the SCT 
program is contributing to increased human 
capital and productivity, both key to enhancing 
greater resilience. Households were found to have 
increased the land they operate by 18 percent, 
maize production by 8 percent, and livestock by 21 
percent. Households also increased their ability to 
meet the material needs of children (clothes, shoes, 
blankets) by 30 percent and increased the number 
of children attending primary school by 10 percent.
Carlyn Hambuba / World Bank
“My life has improved since I started 
receiving SCT payments. The money 
helps me pay for my husband’s medical 
bills and school fees for the orphaned 
children I look after.”

Chapter 3. Building Resilience Now and Into the Future
Debt financing is critical for development, but 
unsustainable levels harm growth and the poor. 
Debt can be a useful tool if it is transparent, well-
managed, and used in the context of a credible 
growth policy, but this is often not the case. High 
public debt can inhibit private investment, increase 
fiscal pressure, reduce social spending, and limit 
governments’ ability to implement reforms. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated debt 
stress in many emerging and developing economies, 
with increased spending on health, incomes, and 
employment. It has forced some countries to borrow 
more and compromised others’ ability to repay 
creditors. For a resilient recovery, debt management 
and transparency need to be top priorities, along 
with domestic resource mobilization. The World 
Bank is helping countries around the world to 
strengthen their capacity to manage debt and tax 
revenue generation, with trust funds providing 
important resources for technical assistance 
and guidance.
For example, the Debt Management Facility (DMF) 
helps countries strengthen debt management to 
reduce debt-related vulnerabilities and improve debt 
transparency. It offers advisory services, training, and 
peer-to-peer learning to more than 80 developing 
countries around the world to strengthen their debt 
management capacity, processes, and institutions. 
DMF efforts have led to more countries preparing and 
publishing debt management strategies, improving 
the quality of government debt records, and better 
organizing their debt management institutions and 
coordination with fiscal policies through alignment 
with medium-term fiscal frameworks.
The Global Tax Program (GTP) enhances the 
World Bank’s capacity to support tax reforms, 
especially at this crucial time. The program provides 
an umbrella framework for tax support and leads an 
ongoing program of activities at both international 
tax and country levels focused on strengthening tax 
institutions and mobilizing revenues. 
For example, the GTP is funding the Kyrgyz 
Republic Tax Reform Technical Assistance Project, 
which is helping the Kyrgyz government to improve 
administrative 
effectiveness 
and 
reduce 
the 
compliance burden for taxpayers. Ongoing since 
2018, the project has provided advice on designing 
tax 
policy 
and 
administration, 
strengthening 
taxpayer communication and outreach, rebuilding 
business processes, and digitizing the issuance 
of tax certificates. The knowledge generated by 
this technical assistance is informing the Tax 
Administration and Statistical System Modernization 
Project for the Kyrgyz Republic approved by the 
World Bank in February 2020.
DEBT MANAGEMENT
GEORGIA: BUILDING A 
FRAMEWORK FOR GREATER 
FISCAL RESILIENCE
The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a steep 
increase in public debt across the world, including 
in Georgia. The government had to borrow 
substantially to finance stringent health measures, 
fiscal stimulus packages, and the deficit due to 
falling tax revenues. Hence, Georgia increased 
domestic debt issuance and, with additional support 
from development partners, the country was able 
to meet its government’s financing needs at a time 
when capital markets were in turmoil. Fortunately, 
Georgia had already built a framework for greater 
resilience, with support from the DMF, prior to 
the pandemic.
The DMF started providing technical assistance to 
Georgia in 2013 with an initial Debt Management 
Performance Assessment followed by a reform plan 
and several support missions for domestic debt 
market development. The assessment identified 
several areas of weaknesses in government debt 
management processes and procedures, as well as 
in the structure of debt and guarantees management. 
Through the assessment, reform plans, and training 
opportunities, the DMF catalyzed significant 
progress in Georgia’s debt management and 
assisted the country in reducing vulnerability 
to financial shocks. DMF training opportunities 
also improved the analytical capacity of debt 
management experts in the Ministry of Finance to 
conduct debt sustainability and portfolio analysis 
and formulate debt management strategies.
Since the initial DMF engagement in 2013, Georgia 
has improved debt management transparency 
with the publication of a semi-annual public 
debt statistical bulletin, monthly debt statistics, 
and annual debt sustainability analysis. The 
government has also developed and published debt 
management strategies, which provide guidance 
for borrowing operations and lay out measures for 
domestic market development. Cash management 
has also improved with the establishment of a cash 
management unit in the Ministry of Finance and the 
introduction of weekly and daily cash flow forecasts 
and active investment of surplus cash.
“I am using the knowledge and 
experience that I gained in the Debt 
Manager’s Practitioner Program to 
develop the domestic debt market  
in Georgia.”

Instruments’ Development Division of the Ministry of 
Finance of Georgia

IFC is also focused on building resilience. The GRID 
approach is apparent in its work with the private 
sector, whose role in development has never been 
more important than in the wake of COVID-19. 
IFC is deploying a comprehensive approach, utilizing 
the Creating Markets Upstream approach, Advisory 
services, and blended finance trust funds, to 
address protracted development challenges around 
the globe and build a pipeline of investment projects 
that will accelerate recovery after the pandemic. 
This constellation of IFC services will help pave the 
way for private sector investment in everything from 
climate change to digital infrastructure. Together 
with the contributions of development partners, 
IFC is de-risking emerging technologies, opening 
frontier markets, and delivering greater impact on 
the ground.
This work is informed by Country Private Sector 
Diagnostics many of which are co-funded with 
development partners,7 and driven by IFC Country 
Strategies. The diagnostics bring together the 
combined expertise of the World Bank and IFC to 
better align country-level engagement in regard 
to private sector development, including with 
development partners. 
An important component is IFC Advisory services, 
which are long-term engagements that build 
capacity and enable markets. As governments 
and companies have had to navigate multiple, 
compounding shocks during the past year, 
IFC’s work is helping to build the foundation for 
greater resilience. 
Advisory projects on digital financial services, for 
example, have helped governments revise their 
legislation to enable financial institutions to launch 
online banking services. As COVID-19 forced the 
closure of many brick-and-mortar bank branches, 
digital financial services have filled the void, making 
it possible for SMEs to continue to access financial 
services. Work with municipalities and infrastructure 
projects have helped to attract private capital for 
public projects, freeing up government resources 
for other needs, while general capacity building 
for SMEs has enabled them to access increased 
financing to meet short-term liquidity needs.
In West Africa, the travel and tourism industry lost 
nearly 30 percent of tourism-related jobs in 2020 
due to the pandemic, which exposed an over-
dependence on foreign travelers. IFC had been 
working to strengthen local tourism value chains 
through the Invest West Africa Tourism project 
funded by two global funds, IFC Support for G-20 
Compact with Africa Initiative (ISCA) and the 
Trust Fund to Facilitate USAID Access to IFC 
Advisory Service’s Expertise and Services. In 
light of COVID-19, IFC shifted its focus to supporting 
companies to access additional sources of financing 
and identify domestic markets. IFC provided 
coaching to 18 supplier companies and worked with 
Côte d’Ivoire’s private-sector support committee 
to develop an online platform that helps affected 
companies identify and apply for loans, grants, and 
other financing support.
Trust funds are also supporting countries to build 
greener, more resilient energy sectors. IFC has 
been advising the government of Uzbekistan to 
transition from natural gas to solar energy through 
the country’s first competitively tendered PPP, the 
Uzbekistan Solar Project. A group of six trust funds8 
is supporting this effort. The success of this tender, 
which will bring the lowest tariff for solar energy in 
Central Asia, has spurred the government to launch 
two additional solar projects expected to add an 
additional 900 MW of solar generation capacity in 
the country. Going forward, this will help boost the 
resilience of Uzbekistan’s energy supply through 
renewable energy. 
7 Of $13.3 million invested in this work so far, $1.5 million came from the IFC’s G-20 Compact with Africa Initiative (ISCA) Trust Fund, 
supported by Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway.
8 Austria-Financial Support of IFC Advisory Services in ECA, Switzerland Financial Support for Advisory Services in ECA, Dutch Climate 
Advisory Partnership (CAP), BMZ PPP Advisory Fund for Infrastructure Investment in Developing Countries, SECO-IFC ECA Advisory 
Services Trust Fund, and Canada-IFC Blended Climate Finance Program
MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH 
AFRICA: BUILDING THE 
CAPACITY OF SMES  
TO NAVIGATE COVID 19
When IFC conducted its 2018 Advisory Services 
Client Survey, clients identified skills training as 
the most anticipated need for the coming years. 
COVID-19 only heightened this need. Many 
micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), 
especially those with weak financial and business 
management skills, are finding it difficult to navigate 
and exit the COVID-19 crisis on a strong footing. 
MSMEs in the Middle East and North Africa 
(MENA) region, in particular, have been slower to 
digitize their operations and move to online sales 
and e-commerce than in other regions. COVID-19 
lockdown measures forced many MSMEs to 
suspend activities entirely.
Arne Hoel / World Bank
In 2020, IFC launched the Grow Learn Connect 
project with support from several trust funds, 
including the MENA MSME 2.0 Trust Fund 
and the Partnership for Resilient Efficient and 
Sustainable SMEs Facility. Recognizing that 
financial institutions play an important role in 
enabling their MSME clients to mitigate business 
financial risks and maintain access to finance, the 
Grow Learn Connect team developed an interactive 
webinar series for MSMEs, focused on increasing 
business resilience and delivered through financial 
institutions. It covered topics such as how to access 
financing during crises, doing business online, and 
communicating with stakeholders during crises. In 
partnership with seven financial institutions, IFC 
delivered the webinar series to more than 1,100 
participants in six countries.
IFC will also work directly with financial institutions 
to create awareness about the benefits of offering 
nonfinancial services to MSMEs, such as business 
development services and access to information 
and markets, to complement and increase uptake of 
their financial services. Although the program was 
born out of a need to respond to COVID-19, IFC’s 
work in building skills and knowledge for financial 
institutions and MSMEs in MENA will benefit 
both types of institutions and result in companies 
that are better equipped to navigate the post-
COVID-19 world.
“Participants benefitted from support 
and advice on how to cope with the 
pandemic—how to adapt their business 
plans, to access finance, to do business 
and market their goods and services 
online, and to communicate with 
stakeholders during crises.”
Mehdi Chahed, IFC-certified master trainer and COVID-19 
webinar facilitator for MSMEs in Tunisia and Morocco

Chapter 3. Building Resilience Now and Into the Future
3.3 FINANCIAL  
INTERMEDIARY FUNDS
FIFs are important financial vehicles that channel 
large-scale grant and concessional financing for 
critical global issues. Like trust funds, many FIFs 
support activities relate to the GRID approach and 
help to scale up collective action in health, climate, 
gender, jobs, and debt sustainability.
More than half (56 percent) of FIF resources were 
transferred to health programs during FY2017–21, 
and one quarter (25 percent) to environment 
and climate-related programs. This includes five 
health-related FIFs that support equitable access 
to COVID-19 vaccines, pandemic preparedness, 
and other aspects of the COVID-19 response 
(Section 2.1) and 12 FIFs that contribute to a range 
of environmental and climate-related activities. 
Other FIFs contribute to education, gender equality, 
infrastructure, and debt relief. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed 
the context in which the work of climate-related FIFs 
is taking place. Urgent and sizeable development 
assistance is needed to support governments, 
businesses, and communities to recover quickly 
from the economic downturn and rebuild for a 
greener, sustainable, and more resilient future. 
Pursuing low-emission and climate-resilient growth 
is the best way to unlock lasting socio-economic 
and environmental benefits. Coupling large-scale 
financial investments with technical assistance in the 
context of COVID-19 lending is advancing climate-
friendly policy reforms. Investments in clean energy 
are creating millions of jobs, while strengthening key 
economic sectors, to bolster COVID-19 recoveries. 
For example, the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) 
provide concessional financing for innovation and 
de-risking alongside multilateral development bank 
(MDB) investments in developing countries. The 
World Bank has been CIF’s largest implementing 
partner, disbursing roughly 50 percent of the funds. 
In April 2020 CIF introduced four new programs 
in the areas of renewable energy integration, 
climate-smart 
urbanization, 
low-carbon 
and 
climate-resilient industries, and nature, people, and 
climate investments. In March 2021, it launched 
the Accelerating Coal Transition (ACT) program, 
which offers a holistic approach to tackling the 
governance, people, and infrastructure challenges 
related to transitioning away from coal. In June 2021, 
four donors (Canada, Germany, USA, and the United 
Kingdom) announced new financial commitments 
of up to $2 billion to support ACT and renewable 
energy integration in developing countries.
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has 
implemented a variety of measures to assist 
countries in addressing the evolving challenges 
arising from the pandemic and to support efforts in 
building back better, greener, and more resilient. Its 
work embraces all facets of a healthy environment, 
including 
climate 
change, 
biodiversity 
loss, 
chemical pollution, and pressure on forests, oceans, 
landscapes, and wildlife. 
The GEF has a central role in restoring a better 
balance between people and nature and in 
addressing the underlying factors of zoonotic 
diseases, such as the global wildlife trade. GEF’s 
integrated programs—the Good Growth Platform, 
the Sustainable Cities Impact Program, the Food, 
Land Use, and Restoration Impact Program, and the 
Wildlife Conservation for Development Program—
are helping countries to build economies and 
societies that will thrive despite inevitable future 
shocks. The proposed GEF-8 strategy for 2022–26 
will continue to build on this systemic approach 
by applying a Healthy Planet, Healthy People 
framework to develop a healthy, productive and 
resilient planet that underpins the well-being of 
human societies.
The Global Partnership for Education (GPE) 
has implemented one of the largest external aid 
programs dedicated to education in the global 
pandemic response. By June 2020, GPE had secured 
$500 million to establish a new accelerated funding 
window for COVID-19 response and recovery 
measures through which grants of $467 million have 
helped 66 partner countries mitigate the impact of 
the pandemic on children’s learning and build more 
resilient education systems. The World Bank has 
been a major implementing entity for these funds 
(Section 2.2). 
As a result of streamlined application and approval 
processes, 
the 
accelerated 
funding 
window 
has facilitated the swift delivery of support to 
countries most in need, with all funds disbursed to 
implementing entities by June 2021. The window 
required GPE funds to be based on the recipients’ 
own response plan, to be complementary to other 
sources of COVID-19 support, and to be focused 
on reaching vulnerable populations (including 
girls, children with disabilities, poor, or displaced 
children) who are most susceptible to fall further 
behind during the pandemic.
The AgResults Initiative uses Pay-for-Results (PfR) 
prize competitions to incentivize the private sector 
to develop and deliver productivity-enhancing 
technologies to smallholder farmers. Its Challenge 
Projects demonstrate how to encourage local 
actors to develop linkages along selected value 
chains to address formerly missing markets with 
contextualized and more resilient solutions. The 
Vietnam GHG Emissions Reduction Challenge 
Project 
(2017–21) 
incentivized 
improved 
rice 
cultivation practices both to increase productivity 
and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 
Tanzania Dairy Challenge Project (launched in 
November 2019) is incentivizing private sector 
suppliers to deliver productivity-enhancing input 
bundles (parasite control, nutrition, vaccines, 
artificial insemination) to both men and women 
smallholder dairy farmers in a socially inclusive way.
Sustainable infrastructure is key to delivering 
economic growth, social progress, and climate 
action in line with the SDGs and Paris Agreement 
commitments. 
Created 
in 
2014, 
the 
Global 
Infrastructure Facility (GIF) is tackling head-on 
the dearth of bankable, sustainable infrastructure 
pipelines in developing countries through the 
provision of end-to-end transaction advisory 
services to national and subnational governments 
through ten MDB Technical Partners. 
The GIF supports developing country governments 
not only to prioritize, design, and structure 
individual low-carbon, climate-smart infrastructure 
transactions, but also to encourage programmatic 
approaches, including standardization efforts, that 
can lead to replication and aggregation. The goal 
is to appeal to institutional capital through better 
coordination with governments and development 
finance institutions. The GIF is heavily promoting 
climate mitigation, adaption and resilience: to date, 
74 percent of its current portfolio and 85 percent of 
its pipeline activities are climate-smart.

Chapter 4. Financial Analytics of World Bank Group Trust Funds and FIFs
FINANCIAL ANALYTICS OF WORLD 
BANK GROUP TRUST FUNDS AND FIFS

Chris Morgan / World Bank
T
he World Bank Group’s trust funds 
and FIFs are strong proof of what 
can be accomplished when development 
partners work together to move toward 
greater resilience. Analysis of key financial 
trends across Bank Group trust funds 
and FIFs further underscores the forward 
momentum of this shared commitment.
This 
chapter 
provides 
aggregate 
financial 
information on the activities of trust funds and FIFs 
administered individually or jointly by the World 
Bank, IFC, MIGA, and ICSID, as well as externally 
financed outputs (EFOs). It looks at five-year 
trends, from FY2017 to FY2021, on trust fund and FIF 
inflows, outflows, and assets under management—
all of which demonstrate the World Bank Group’s 
position as the partner of choice to advance 
development agendas in countries, regions, and 
around the globe. Box 4.1 defines financial terms and 
Table 4.1 provides an overview of key financial data.
INFLOWS
Inflows, or contributions to World Bank Group trust 
funds and FIF, have remained strong and have shown 
an increase over the last five years, reaching $14.31 
billion in FY2021. In particular, cash contributions to 
IBRD/IDA trust funds rose to $4.08 billion in FY2021, 
an increase of 11 percent ($414 million) from FY2020 
primarily driven by cash contributions to the Sudan 
Transition and Recovery Support Program (STARS), 
the Global Financing Facility (GFF), and the Sint 
Maarten Recovery and Resilience Program. 
IFC trust fund contributions increased by 18 percent 
($48 million) in FY2021 compared to FY2020. Paid-in 
contributions (cash and promissory notes receipts) 
to FIFs increased from $8.94 billion in FY2020 to $9.91 
billion in FY2021. This increase was primarily due to 
increased contributions to the Green Climate Fund 
(GCF), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness 
Innovations (CEPI), and the Global Environment 
Facility (GEF). Almost 80 percent of this increase is 
to CEPI for the COVID-19 response. 
Development partners recognize the strategic 
advantages of entrusting their resources with 
the World Bank Group. It has the technical 
expertise, country experience, and supervision and 
reporting capacity to ensure funds are directed to 
development activities that align with agreed 
priorities and achieve impact at scale. Efficiency, 
relevance, global reach, and influential convening 
power are all reasons why development partners 
choose to contribute to trust funds and FIFs 
managed by the World Bank Group.
OUTFLOWS
Outflows, or disbursements from World Bank Group 
trust funds and cash transfers from FIFs, have 
increased in the last five years to reach $12.97 billion 
in FY2021. IBRD/IDA trust fund disbursements 
were $3.57 billion in FY2021, an increase of 2 
percent ($75 million) from FY2020. RE activities 
accounted for around 71 percent ($2.55 billion) of 
total disbursements and BE activities 29 percent 
($1.03 billion). The higher disbursements were 
driven mainly by STARS, the Global Partnership for 
Education (IBRD as implementing entity), and the 
Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (IBRD as 
implementing entity). 
Annual cash transfers from FIFs to implementing 
entities increased from $7.66 billion in FY2020 
to $10.03 billion in FY2021. The increase in cash 
transfers was driven by the International Finance 
Facility for Immunisation; the Global Fund to Fight 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund); 
and the Advanced Market Commitments for 
Pneumococcal Vaccines for their support in helping 
countries strengthen health systems and mitigate 
the impact of COVID-19. Cash transfers from 
FIFs include transfers for all purposes, including 
secretariat costs and administrative expenses.

Chapter 4. Financial Analytics of World Bank Group Trust Funds and FIFs
The World Bank Group is strategic in deploying 
trust fund and FIF resources to complement its own 
funding and deepen support for specific objectives 
shared by clients and donors, as well as to deliver 
timely financial responses to emergencies like the 
COVID-19 crisis. The share of FIF resources that 
the World Bank implements reflect this strategic 
alignment. Nearly one-third (28 percent) of trust fund 
disbursements for RE activities during the last five 
years have come from FIF resources implemented 
by the World Bank.
Trust fund support for advisory services that the 
Bank Group provides to public and private sector 
clients is also significant. Nearly all of IFC’s Advisory 
services and two-thirds of the World Bank’s ASA 
are funded by trust funds, allowing the Bank Group 
to build knowledge, inform policy dialogue, and 
enhance enabling environments. Trust-funded 
activities also bring World Bank Group support 
to locations outside the immediate reach of its 
financing instruments. 
ASSET MANAGEMENT
Asset management is another important way in 
which the World Bank Group brings value to trust 
fund and FIF partnerships. As trustee, the World 
Bank receives and invests development partner 
contributions to trust funds and FIFs until funds 
are disbursed to final recipients for development 
objectives. In FY2017–21, investment income earned 
on trust fund and FIF funds held in trust (FHIT) 
totaled $2.66 billion.
The trust fund and FIF portfolios have grown 
over the years due to an increase in development 
partners’ contributions for multi-year projects, an 
increase in the number of trust funds managed by 
the World Bank Group, and investment returns. As 
of June 30, 2021, the amount of funds held by the 
World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs reached 
$40.24 billion. The top three IBRD/IDA programs 
with large amounts of FHIT (cash and investments) 
were the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, 
the Carbon Finance Fund, and the GFF, and the 
top three FIFs were the GCF, GEF, and the Climate 
Investment Funds.
The World Bank’s investment management services 
aim to preserve donor funds and enhance their 
value while accommodating the varying liquidity 
needs and risk preferences of different trust funds 
and FIFs. Participating funds benefit from access 
to a wide variety of investment products and longer 
terms of maturity to enhance investment returns 
over time. Environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) investment solutions and product offerings 
also cater to the sustainable responsible investing 
aspirations of participating funds. 
Dominic Chavez / World Bank
Inflows: Cash contributions to trust funds include encashment of promissory notes and cash receipts 
from donors. For FIFs, paid-in contributions include receipts in the form of cash or promissory notes, 
and other sources of funds, such as Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) and bond issuances, but 
not including investment income.
All contributions paid-in (cash and promissory notes, net of certain discounts) are reported using the 
date of receipt. It may also include contribution transfers from other trust funds. Amounts to donor 
balance and holding accounts have been excluded. From FY2017, most contributors to the Global Fund 
provided contributions directly to its secretariat, and the trustee receives these funds as contributions 
from the Global Fund Secretariat as a contributor. 
Outflows: Disbursements from trust funds and cash transfers from FIFs to implementing entities for 
development activities. For accounting purposes, FIF transfers to the World Bank as an implementing 
entity are not included in FIF disbursements but transferred and later recorded as IBRD/IDA trust fund 
disbursements.
Assets: Funds held in trust (FHIT) are comprised of cash, investments, and promissory notes 
receivable at the end of the fiscal year. “Other” FHIT includes amounts held in escrow on behalf of 
the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Dispute (ICSID), donor balance accounts (DBA), 
balances on administration accounts, and unapplied receipts. The total amount of DBA balances held 
was $394 million at the end of FY2021.
Externally financed outputs (EFO): Funding instrument used for activities (often research work) that 
do not exceed a 36-month timeframe and $2 million contribution limit.
Due to rounding, disbursements below $50 million are displayed as $0.00 million and other figures 
presented in this chapter may not add up to totals.

percent ($3.13 billion) of total cash contributions 
received in FY2021 and 78 percent during the 
last five years (FY2017–21). The increase in cash 
contributions ($151 million) in FY2021 compared to 
FY2020 was primarily due to larger contributions 
by Norway, the Netherlands, and Germany.

Transfers from FIFs to projects implemented by the World Bank Group decreased from 11 percent of the total 
transfers from FIFs to all implementing entities in FY2020 ($0.8 billion) to 8 percent in FY2021 ($0.7 billion). 
The largest transfer amounts in FY2021 were from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) at $215 million, 
followed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) at $154 million and the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) 
at $96 million. On a cumulative basis spanning FY2017–21, the World Bank Group as an implementing entity 
received the largest amount of transfers from the GPE ($1.3 billion), followed by CIF ($1.1 billion) and the Global 
Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) ($0.6 billion).
14 An implementing entity is any agency that receives funds from a FIF and is responsible for managing those funds for activities as 
approved by the governing body.
15 Transfers to implementing entities include transfers for project preparation, supervision fees, project implementation, and special 
agreement transfers for HIPC and AMC. However, in the case of the Global Fund, there is a lump sum transfer to the secretariat, and 
the use of the transferred funds is determined by the Global Fund. The GEF Secretariat acts as an implementing entity for a limited 
number of projects, i.e. the National Portfolio Formulation Exercises. Transfers to implementing entities exclude a one-time transfer 
of $383 million from the GEF to IBRD to cover reevaluation of grants denominated in Special Drawing Rights (from 2004). Non-USD 
transfers are valued as of June 30, 2021.

DISBURSEMENTS AND CASH 
TRANSFERS 
Total World Bank Group trust fund disbursements 
were $3.82 billion in FY2021. The marginal increase 
in disbursements and cash transfers from IBRD/IDA 
trust funds in FY2021 were mainly from the Sudan 
Transition and Recovery Support Program (up by 
$95 million) and IBRD as an implementing entity 
of the Global Partnership for Education (up by $67 
million) and the Pandemic Emergency Financing 
Facility (up by $63 million). IBRD/IDA trust funds 
accounted for 94 percent of World Bank Group 
disbursements and cash transfers from trust funds 
in FY2021, and IFC trust funds accounted for the 
remaining 6 percent.
FIFs continue to play a significant role in the 
international aid architecture. The average amount 
of annual transfers from FIFs during FY2017–21 
was $7.37 billion. The annual transfer from FIFs to 
implementing entities increased from $7.66 billion 
in FY2020 to $10.03 billion in FY2021, primarily due 
to an increase of $2.93 billion in transfers from the 
International Finance Facility for Immunisation; 
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria; and the Advanced Market Commitments for 
Pneumococcal Vaccines in response to COVID-19. 
This was offset by a decrease in transfers from the 
Climate Investment Funds, the Global Environment 
Facility, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness 
Innovations, and the Global Agriculture and Food 
Security Program.

In FY2017–21, the top 20 trust fund programs 
accounted for 63 percent of the total IBRD/IDA trust 
fund disbursements ($18.46 billion). The highest 
disbursements were made from the Afghanistan 
Reconstruction Trust Fund ($3.90 billion), followed 
by other large disbursements made by the World 
Bank in its role as implementing entity for FIFs like 
the Global Partnership for Education ($1.49 billion),

Cumulative IBRD/IDA trust fund disbursements for RE activities during FY2017–21 were $13.29 billion. The 
highest annual level of $2.92 billion in FY2017 decreased to $2.55 billion in FY2021. IDA countries continue 
to receive the largest share of disbursements for RE activities year after year, with 66 percent of total RE 
disbursements in FY2021. Over the past five years, approximately $1 out of every $9 disbursed to IDA and IDA-
IBRD blend countries16 was from trust-funded RE activities. Approximately 19 percent of the total trust fund 
disbursements for RE activities were to IBRD countries.
Out of $5.2 billion in cumulative trust fund disbursements for BE activities during the last five years, about $1 
billion were for activities that support IDA countries. Compared to FY2017, trust fund disbursements for BE 
activities to support IDA countries declined by 6 percent to $191 million in FY2021, trust fund disbursements for 
BE activities to support IBRD-IDA blend countries dropped by 25 percent to $50 million in FY2021, and trust

DISBURSEMENTS FROM IBRD, IDA, AND TRUST FUNDS FOR RE ACTIVITIES
Trust funds regularly co-finance IBRD and IDA projects, increasing scale and reach and filling knowledge 
and financing gaps. They provide grant financing where client countries are reluctant to borrow, reducing 
transactions costs and allowing development partners to build on World Bank Group technical and operational 
capacity to maximize impact. During the past five years, trust fund disbursements for RE activities in client 
countries have averaged 7 percent of total World Bank RE disbursements—a share that peaked at 9 percent in 
FY2017 and fell to 5 percent in FY2021. 
Total trust fund disbursements from RE activities (including stand-alone trust funds, co-financing trust funds, 
and other trust funds)18 declined by 13 percent from $2.92 billion in FY2017 to $2.55 billion in FY2021. This decline 
was primarily due to lower disbursements from the following trust fund programs: Afghanistan Reconstruction 
Trust Fund, IBRD as an implementing entity for FIFs (i.e., Global Partnership for Education, Climate Investment 
Funds, and Global Environment Facility), and the Carbon Finance Fund. IBRD and IDA disbursements also 
varied during FY2017–21, with increased disbursements in FY2021 compared to FY2020 to combat the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Stand-alone trust fund disbursements for RE activities decreased from $1.48 billion in FY2017 to $0.68 billion 
in FY2021, or 27 percent of total FY2021 trust fund disbursements for RE activities ($2.55 billion). Meanwhile, 
disbursements from co-financing trust funds continued an upward trajectory, from 36 percent ($1.04 billion) of 
total trust fund disbursements for RE activities in FY2017 to 62 percent ($1.58 billion) in FY2021. Rounding out 
FY2021 disbursements were grants that financed other lending projects ($0.26 billion).

RE grants are important financing instruments to respond to the needs of states affected by FCV. While trust 
fund disbursements for RE activities in these countries decreased in absolute amounts from $1.36 billion in 
FY2017 to $1.27 billion in FY2021, their share increased from 46 percent in FY2017 to 50 percent in FY2021. 
In FY2021, Afghanistan accounted for a significant portion (51 percent, $0.65 billion) of total trust fund 
disbursements for RE activities in states affected by FCV followed by Sudan ($119 million), the West Bank and 
Gaza ($100 million), Mozambique ($79 million), Democratic Republic of Congo ($60 million), and Somalia ($39 
million). RE disbursements to countries affected by FCV (excluding Afghanistan) averaged around $0.5 billion 
in FY2017–21.

REGIONAL SHARES OF TRUST FUND DISBURSEMENTS FOR RE ACTIVITIES
Among the World Bank’s Regional Units, the South Asia Region (SAR) was the largest beneficiary of trust fund 
disbursements for RE activities, with $840 million in FY2021. The Eastern and Southern Africa Region (AFE) 
was the second largest beneficiary at $694 million, followed by the Western and Central Africa (AFW) at $225 
million, Latin America and Caribbean (LCR) at $221 million, East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) at $196 million, and 
Europe and Central Asia (ECA) at $152 million. 
Compared with FY2020, trust fund disbursements for RE activities in AFE increased by 21 percent in FY2021, 
primarily due to an increase in disbursement from the Sudan Transition and Recovery Support Program ($95 
million), IBRD as implementing entity for the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) ($42 million), and the 
Somalia Multi Partner Fund ($19 million). Trust fund disbursements for RE activities in SAR increased by 6 
percent mainly driven by an increase in disbursements from the Community and Capacity Development 
Support Program ($14 million), IBRD as implementing entity for the Global Environment Facility ($9 million), 
and the IBRD as implementing entity for GPE ($8 million).

DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR ADVISORY SERVICES AND ANALYTICS 
Trust fund financing for BE activities represents a significant share of the World Bank’s expenditures on ASA 
at 63 percent in FY2021. This large share of externally financed ASA provides opportunities to work with 
development partners on the knowledge agenda, while also introducing challenges to the Bank’s ability to plan 
and align its work to its strategic priorities. These challenges are being addressed as a part of the ongoing trust 
fund reforms.

4.3 ASSETS 
Trust fund assets consist of funds held in trust (FHIT)—cash, investments, promissory notes and contribution 
receivables. These assets are managed and reported separately for IBRD/IDA trust funds, IFC trust funds, and 
FIFs following established reporting protocols.
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT 
The World Bank manages the liquid assets of trust funds and FIFs in a single, commingled investment pool that 
provides the following benefits to its participants: 
• A selection of sub-portfolios or model portfolios to accommodate varying liquidity needs and risk 
preferences of different funds, managed within a comprehensive risk management framework
• Access to a wide variety of investment products and longer terms of maturity to enhance investment 
returns over time
• Regular review of liquidity needs across funds to optimize investments over the longer term
• Standardized and customized ESG investment solutions and product offerings to cater to various 
sustainable responsible investing (SRI) aspirations of individual funds
These investments earn income based on the trust fund’s share of interest income, realized gains or losses 
from the sale of securities, and unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the asset value held by the 
pool at fair value. During FY2017–21, investment income on trust fund and FIF assets totaled $2.66 billion, with 
a peak in FY2019 at $882 million and a decline in FY2021 to $201 million.

Chapter 4. Financial Analytics of World Bank Group Trust Funds and FIFs
ASSET MIX OF TRUST FUNDS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 
Upon receipt of development partner contributions to a trust fund, the World Bank invests these resources in 
the international capital markets until they are disbursed to final recipients. Trust fund assets are managed with 
the primary investment objective of capital preservation and liquidity on demand. 
The provisions of the World Bank’s General Investment Authorizations for IBRD and IDA also apply to the 
investment of trust fund assets. Accordingly, these assets are managed within conservative overall risk tolerance 
parameters and invested in high quality securities, which include securities issued by sovereign governments, 
government agencies, and multilateral and other official institutions, asset-backed and agency-guaranteed 
mortgage-backed securities, as well as swaps and a range of derivatives in support of securities investments. 
Subject to the primary investment objective, the asset mix among the investment products authorized by 
the General Investment Authorizations is based on market opportunities available within the applicable risk 
limits. As part of monitoring and financial and risk management oversight, a regular rebalancing of assets is 
performed to ensure that enough liquidity is available to meet disbursements needs.
The portfolio asset allocation as of FY2021 reflects this conservative investment approach and defensive 
positioning to maintain the portfolio within the policy risk tolerance. The portfolio includes a large allocation 
of 40 percent invested in sovereign government bonds, followed by 19 percent in cash and money market 
instruments, 13 percent in corporate-covered bonds, and 12 percent in agencies. The rest of the portfolio is 
invested in sovereign government bonds, asset-backed securities, and a small allocation to equities. 
The Investment Management of World Bank Group Trust Fund offers more details about how the World Bank 
manages and invests development partner financial resources.

FIGURE 4.14
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND 
GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS
There has been a major shift in the global asset 
management industry toward sustainable and 
responsible investing (SRI), with rapidly growing 
awareness of global environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) issues. The World Bank Group is 
committed to a more ambitious development agenda 
focusing on the SDGs and helping client countries 
to achieve their climate action targets. The Bank 
Group takes pride in incorporating sustainability-
related themes in all operational activities, including 
the investment management function entrusted to it 
by its clients. 
Since July 2019, the World Bank Treasury has 
applied ESG Integration as the default SRI 
approach for all portfolios managed by the 
World Bank. ESG Integration explicitly considers 
material ESG factors in the investment process 
and is intended to help fulfil the existing 
investment objectives without changes to the 
current investment objectives or risk limits of the 
portfolios for which it is used. Endorsed by World 
Bank Management, ESG Integration is the most 
appropriate SRI approach within the purview of 
the IBRD/IDA General Investment Authorizations 
and clients’ investment guidelines as stipulated in 
the Investment Management Agreements.
The World Bank continues to explore additional SRI 
strategies in line with the current market practices to 
meet the evolving SRI aspirations and development 
objectives of the development partners. In FY2021, 
the World Bank implemented its Sustainable Bond 
Strategy, which seeks to invest in high-grade 
bond and cash instruments that generate positive 
sustainable development impacts while retaining 
the overarching investment objectives of the trust 
funds and FIFs. The strategy is formulated based on 
three core commitments:
• A focus on high-grade fixed-income investments 
aiming to generate positive impact outcomes
• Fundamental fixed-income risk disciplines with 
no compromise on returns
• Transparent and reliable impact reporting
The strategy is implemented following a gradual 
and phased approach, alongside the development 
of the sustainable bond market. Initially, it will focus 
on sovereign bonds, governmental agency bonds, 
and supra-national bonds through a process of 
positive identification, wherein rigorous analytical 
assessments are performed to identify bonds 
from the investable universe that have verifiable 
sustainability impact. In time, the strategy could 
adopt 
the 
same 
sustainability 
methodology 
of positive selection to a wider investment 
universe, encompassing, for example, high-grade 
corporate bonds.

Chapter 4. Financial Analytics of World Bank Group Trust Funds and FIFs
FUNDS HELD IN TRUST
Funds held in trust (FHIT) are comprised of cash, investments, and promissory notes, or similar obligations, 
received but not encashed at the end of the fiscal year. It reflects, at a point in time, contributions paid-in from 
contributors and investment income earned less cash transfers from FIFs to IBRD/IDA trust funds when the 
Bank acts as implementing entity for FIFs. The top decile of the IBRD/IDA trust funds (measured by FHIT) held 
77 percent of total FHIT as of June 30, 2021. 
These trust funds broadly demonstrate a link to high priority areas, such as states affected by FCV (Afghanistan, 
West Bank and Gaza), themes (climate change), and support to the SDGs (health, nutrition, and population). 
The bottom eight deciles held 12 percent of total FHIT. While the long tail of smaller funds can provide important 
funding for innovation and knowledge, fragmentation poses challenges to linking with strategic priorities 
and achieving greater development outcomes. Small, customized trust funds may also increase transactions 
costs associated with fundraising, establishment, heterogeneous governance, results frameworks, and 
reporting requirements.

FIGURE 4.15
DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS HELD IN TRUST
As of the end of FY2021, FHIT for IBRD/IDA trust funds was $12.44 billion (including $0.09 billion of MIGA trust 
funds), an increase of 10 percent ($1.13 billion) compared to the end of FY2020. The increase was primarily due 
to larger FHIT for the Sudan Transition and Recovery Support Program ($339 million), the Global Financing 
Facility ($294 million), IBRD as an implementing entity for the Green Climate Fund ($155 million), and the 
Canada Climate Innovation Financing Facility ($138 million). The FHIT for FIFs increased by $1.8 billion (7 
percent) from $24.15 billion to $25.96 billion during FY2021. The increase was primarily due to larger FHIT for 
the Green Climate Fund ($1.69 billion), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ($863 million), 
the Global Environment Facility ($244 million), and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program 
($166 million).

Chapter 4. Financial Analytics of World Bank Group Trust Funds and FIFs
DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS
The amount of assets—comprising cash and investments, promissory notes receivable, and contributions 
receivable—for World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs amounted to $54.21 billion at the end of FY2021. The 
share of cash and investments amounted to 62 percent of total assets, and the share of contributions receivable 
and promissory notes receivable was 26 percent and 12 percent, respectively.21,22 FIFs held $35.68 billion (66 
percent) at the end of FY2021, IBRD/IDA trust funds held $16.28 billion (30 percent), IFC trust funds $1.29 billion 
(2 percent), and other trust funds $0.94 billion (2 percent). 
Distribution of Assets: Cash and Investments, Promissory Notes Receivable,  
and Contributions Receivable, FY2021 ($ billions)
FIGURE 4.17
21 Contributions receivable refers to any portion of a contribution that is not a qualified contribution, to be received in the form of cash or 
a promissory note.
22 Promissory notes receivable refers to the balance of promissory notes not yet received in cash.
4.4 EXTERNALLY FINANCED OUTPUTS
Externally financed outputs (EFOs) are funding instruments used for activities that have a finite time frame (36 
months) and an upper limit of $2 million for receiving contributions. Activities that exceed these parameters do 
not qualify for EFOs and trust funds then become the preferred instrument. EFOs can be used to support single 
or multiple bank activities or outputs that are managed by the same Vice-Presidential Unit, are part of the same 
project, and are consistent with the Bank’s work program. 
EFO CONTRIBUTIONS PAID-IN 
Total EFO contributions paid-in during FY2017–21 totaled $234 million, with the annual average contribution 
paid-in at $47 million. The FY2021 contributions paid-in decreased by 39 percent (down by $22 million) 
compared to FY2020.
Among World Bank Regions, the Eastern and Southern Africa Region (AFE) received the highest contributions 
paid-in at 15 percent ($36 million) during FY2017–21, excluding global EFOs (38 percent). Recipient countries 
such as Ethiopia, Malawi, Somalia, and Sudan received higher contributions that led to a spike in FY2019 
contributions. AFE received an annual average of $7 million and the Middle East and North Africa Region 
(MENA) received an annual average of $5 million during the five-year period.

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a group of smiling children, likely in a classroom given the background with windows and other children, wearing blue uniforms. The children appear to be expressing joy or excitement, reaching their hands toward the camera. The photograph is framed by circular graphics in black and blue, which overlay the image and add a modern, dynamic feel to the layout.

The children are centered prominently, and the circular design frames them, directing focus. There is no visible text within the image itself. The circular graphic design and the joyful image of the children suggest a positive, hopeful tone, fitting for an annual development report that may be highlighting progress or success in educational or social programs.

**Image Description:**
The image shows a classroom setting with several young children seated at wooden desks. The children, all wearing school uniforms, are smiling and appear engaged. Each child has a plastic bowl in front of them, with some bowls being green with blue lids and others white with blue lids. Some children wear face masks, either around their necks or on their faces, suggesting health precautions are being observed.

The background is relatively dim, with muted walls and a window allowing some natural light into the room. The focus is on the children, particularly a boy in the middle foreground who is looking directly at the camera with a friendly expression.

There is no text visible in the image. The layout captures a candid, warm moment of children in a learning environment, aligning well with themes of education and development typical in annual reports.

**Image Description:**
The image shows a portion of a document with a page curl effect on the top-right corner, giving the impression that the page is being turned. The visible part of the page is mostly white with no text, images, or other design elements apparent in this cropped view. The background behind the page is solid black, creating a strong contrast with the white page. This layout is often used to indicate a page-turning or to highlight the edge of a document in digital formats. Since this is said to be part of an annual development report, the image likely serves as a visual or design element rather than containing key report content itself.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a cleanroom or laboratory setting with a group of workers seated on both sides of a long arrangement of blue plastic trays. Each worker is wearing white lab coats, light blue hair covers, face masks in various colors, and yellow gloves, indicating adherence to hygiene protocols. 

The workers are handling small items, including boxes and vials with pink tops, possibly related to pharmaceuticals or medical supplies. The room has a sterile, white interior with a green floor, fluorescent ceiling lights, and a blue door at the far end.

There is no visible text in the image itself, but the scene clearly represents an organized and controlled production or inspection process, likely part of an industrial or medical product manufacturing environment. This image fits well within an annual development report to showcase production quality, workforce engagement, or sterility standards in the manufacturing process.

**Image Description:**
The image shows a corner of a page being curled up, revealing the backside of the page. The front side is completely black, and the backside appears white. There are no visible text or other key elements in the image.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image is a simple and clean page from an annual development report. Its layout features a plain background with a gradient or layered light blue arc design on the bottom right corner, which adds a subtle decorative element without overwhelming the page.

Key elements include:
- A large amount of blank space, likely intended for text or other content that is not present in the image provided.
- The text "ANNUAL DEVELOPMENT REPORT" is faintly visible, written diagonally in a very light, semi-transparent font across the center of the page, blending softly into the background.

The overall design is professional and minimalistic, with an emphasis on a neat and airy visual style suitable for formal reports. The lack of additional graphics or text suggests this might be a title page or a background template for other content.

They are standing in a line against a teal blue wall that appears slightly worn, adding a textured background to the scene. The focus is primarily on a man in the center looking directly at the camera, while the others are slightly blurred or gazing in other directions. The individuals are posed professionally, indicating a serious or formal atmosphere.

There is no visible text in the image. The overall layout suggests a candid yet composed moment within a healthcare or clinical environment, suitable for inclusion in an annual development report highlighting medical staff, health initiatives, or training programs.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of a woman holding a baby. The woman, dressed in a dark purple top with green straps, looks down at something out of the frame. The baby, wearing a yellow outfit with white accents and a large yellow and white bow on her head, is holding a piece of paper and has a pink pacifier in her mouth. The baby is looking directly at the camera while the woman has a gentle expression, with her eyes cast downward. The background is plain, light-colored, and unobtrusive, keeping the focus on the subjects. There is no visible text in the image. This image could be highlighting themes such as maternal care, early childhood, or personal stories within the context of an annual development report.
```
![Image 1](images/2022TrustFundAnnualReports_p14_img1.png)

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a single sheet of paper with the top-right corner curled downward and partially folded over. The sheet is white, and the background is black, creating a clear contrast. There is no visible text, graphics, or other key elements on the paper itself; it appears blank from the visible side. The curled corner suggests a sense of turning a page or revealing information, which can be symbolic for an annual development report cover or section divider.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a scene of urban devastation featuring two tall apartment buildings that are severely damaged, likely from warfare or a major disaster. The buildings have multiple broken windows and charred walls, indicating fire damage. Both buildings are split by a clear gap in the middle, emphasizing the extent of structural destruction.

In the foreground, there is a sidewalk with two people walking side by side carrying bags, suggesting daily life activities continuing despite the surroundings. The walkway is bordered by patches of greenery, including several small trees and bushes, which add some contrast to the otherwise bleak environment.

A small visible detail on the left building is a yellow banner or sign hanging, though the text on it is difficult to fully discern. The overall atmosphere of the image juxtaposes destruction with everyday human resilience.

There is no visible overlay text or caption on the image itself. The composition and key elements serve to illustrate the impact of conflict or disaster on urban infrastructure and the persistence of civilian life amidst it.

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image depicts a single page being turned, revealing the back side of the page. The visible part shows a curled corner at the top right, suggesting the action of flipping the page. The page itself is blank, with no text or graphical elements visible on either the front or back side. The background surrounding the page is solid black, making the white page stand out prominently. This image symbolizes the concept of moving forward, progress, or unveiling new information, fitting for an annual development report.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a busy outdoor scene with many people gathered around. In the foreground, a woman wearing a face mask is placing her finger on a biometric scanner that is connected to an electronic device on a wooden table. She is dressed in a light-colored traditional outfit with a striped scarf. Behind her, several women and children, some also wearing face masks, are standing in line or waiting. Many women are dressed in colorful traditional clothes, including bright pinks, yellows, reds, and oranges. One woman in the middle of the image is holding a child, and more children are visible throughout the scene. The background shows trees and a building, indicating the setting might be a community event or aid distribution point.

There is no visible text in the image. The key elements include the biometric scanner and payment or identification device on the table, the crowd of people, the woman using the scanner, and the outdoor rural environment. This image likely relates to an initiative involving biometric verification or distribution of aid services in the annual development report.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image layout features a close-up, indoor setting primarily showing two individuals. On the left side, a healthcare worker wearing a white uniform, protective hair net, glasses, and a white face mask is administering an injection to a seated patient on the right side. The patient is wearing a green face mask and has their right arm exposed for the injection.

The background includes a window with light blue curtains letting in natural light, and there are colorful posters or charts on a yellow wall behind them, suggesting a medical or clinical environment.

The healthcare worker's uniform has featured text that reads:
"Ministerio de Saúde" 
and below that in smaller font:
"Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde"
which translates from Portuguese as "Ministry of Health" and "Health Surveillance Secretariat."

The key elements are the vaccination procedure, the medical professional's protective attire, and the clinical setting, likely emphasizing health initiatives as part of the annual development report.
```

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a schematic or infographic titled "Land area and water bodies." It features a large circular pie chart divided into several color-coded segments representing different types of land and water areas. 

Key elements include:
- A pie chart with colors representing various categories:
  - **Blue segment:** "Oceans and seas" covering 70.8%
  - **Yellow segment:** "Ice caps and glaciers" covering 1.7%
  - **Light blue segment:** "Other water bodies" covering 1.7%
  - **Green segment:** "Forests" covering 10.6%
  - **Brown segment:** "Other land area" covering 8.4%
  - **Dark green segment:** "Grassland" covering 8.2%
  - **Purple segment:** "Cropland" covering 11.4%
- Each segment has a label along with the percentage it represents.
- The title "Land area and water bodies" is placed prominently at the top.
- The overall style is clean with clear, readable text and distinct colors to differentiate categories.

This infographic likely aims to visually summarize the proportions of Earth's surface covered by various natural and geographical features for the annual development report.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a healthcare worker, likely a nurse or medical professional, in a clinical setting. The worker is a woman with curly hair wearing a white lab coat and a blue surgical mask. She is standing beside a medical storage cart or table and appears to be preparing or handling medical supplies. 

Key elements in the image include:

- A large grey cooler box on the cart, labeled with some handwritten text in blue and red (the text is partially visible and unclear).
- A container filled with cotton balls and a pump bottle of hand sanitizer or soap are also visible on the cart.
- The background shows a brightly lit room with pale blue and yellow walls.
- There are educational posters on the wall, showing food items and nutrition guidance.
- An open window with sheer blue curtains allows natural light into the room.
- Part of a sink and hand soap dispenser is visible on the left side near the window.
- There is a door with a notice or instruction sheet attached to it on the right side.

The setting appears to be a medical or vaccination clinic, focused on health and hygiene, likely included as part of an annual development report to highlight healthcare improvements or vaccination programs.
```

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image is a stylized graphic of a page corner being folded or turned, revealing a white backside beneath a black front. The curl is positioned in the top-right corner of the image. There is no text or additional elements visible on the page itself, just the clean black and white contrast between the front and the back of the page. This design suggests the idea of turning a page, which fits well with themes of progress or moving forward, appropriate for an annual development report.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**

**Image Description:**
The image depicts an indoor scene inside a small retail store or convenience shop. 

Layout and Key Elements:
- In the foreground on the left side, there is a shelving unit stocked with various packaged products, including chewing gum brands like Orbit and possibly chocolate bars.
- At the center-left, a man wearing a white t-shirt and a black face mask is holding a card reader or point-of-sale device.
- On the right side, there is another person wearing a black t-shirt and a black face mask, extending a card towards the card reader held by the first man, indicating a contactless payment.
- The background is filled with various packaged goods, including snacks and small grocery items, housed on metal shelves.
- There is a blue sign prominently displayed behind the man with the card reader, with a visible graphic of what seems to be a small card or product, and text in a language that is not entirely clear but includes "FINE" and "COMPACT."
- The store counter in the center has papers and a point-of-sale terminal stand.
- Both individuals are wearing masks, suggesting health precautions.

Text on the Blue Sign (partial and unclear):
- "FINE"
- "COMPACT"
- Some smaller, less legible text below

The image suggests a theme related to retail transactions, the use of digital payment methods, and possibly small business commerce. It would fit well in an annual development report section focused on technological adoption, retail infrastructure, or economic activities at the local

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image appears to be a mockup or design representation of a single page from a report or document. Here is a detailed description of its layout and key elements:

- The page is set against a black background, highlighting the page itself.
- The top-right corner of the page is slightly curled or folded down, revealing the underside of the page.
- The page appears mostly white with some subtle design elements, but due to the angle and lighting, the text or specific content on the page is not clearly visible or readable.
- There are no visible large headings or prominent graphics discernible on the page based on this view.
- The overall impression is that of a clean, crisp page likely part of a professional report, consistent with an annual development report layout.

If you have more images or specific sections of the document, I can help describe those in greater detail or extract any visible text.

**Image Description:**
The image shows a woman seated in a fabric shop or market stall surrounded by stacks of folded colorful fabrics. The background and sides are filled with neatly piled bolts of fabric in a variety of bright colors and patterns, arranged vertically on racks or shelves. The woman is holding up a piece of blue fabric with a large white star and part of another white shape visible, which resembles the flag of Somalia. She is wearing a patterned dress and a black headscarf. The setting appears to be informal, likely a local market or small business. 

There is no visible text in the image. The focus is on the woman and the fabrics around her, highlighting textile trade or local commerce, which is a common element in development reports showcasing economic activities or livelihoods.

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a graphic of a single page that appears to be partially curled or folded at the top-right corner, revealing the back side of the page. The page itself is blank and white with no visible text, images, or other content. The background surrounding the page is completely black, which makes the white page and the curled corner stand out prominently.

Key elements:
- White page
- Top-right corner of the page is curled/folded, exposing the back side of the page (also white)
- Solid black background
- No text or imagery on the page

This image might be used as a design element or placeholder in a report, possibly symbolizing the start of a new section or an invitation to turn the page.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a group of six men standing outdoors with greenery and trees in the background, indicating a forest or natural reserve setting. The men are wearing various uniforms, suggesting roles related to wildlife, forest management, or conservation. One man is wearing a black t-shirt with the word "RANGER" printed in white on it, indicating that he is likely a park ranger or forest ranger. Some men have binoculars hanging around their necks, which is typical for individuals involved in monitoring wildlife or patrolling a natural area. The overall mood appears professional and focused on nature or environmental work. 

There is no text visible in the image beyond the "RANGER" label on the t-shirt. The image is suitable for inclusion in an annual development report highlighting activities, team members, or conservation efforts related to forest or wildlife management.
```

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image depicts a page with a curled top right corner. The page background is predominantly white. At the top center of the page, there is text that reads, "2020 Annual Development Report." The page appears to be blank aside from this text, with no other visible elements or decorations. The curled corner adds a visual effect that suggests the page might be turned or lifted.

OLLIVIER GIRARD / THE GLOBAL FINANCING FACILITY


**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a group of people, mostly women, gathered outdoors in what appears to be a discussion or meeting. The setting is informal with a rustic background that includes a building façade and a fence with barbed wire. 

Key elements:
- Two women sit at a wooden table in the center of the image; one is wearing a white garment and a face mask while the other wears a light purple garment.
- Surrounding them, several women stand or sit, dressed in colorful traditional attire and some wearing face masks.
- One woman in a black garment with a red head covering is gesturing animatedly towards the seated woman in purple.
- A young man sits on the ground in the lower right corner, resting his head on his hand, appearing to observe.
- The environment suggests a serious or engaged conversation, possibly about community or social matters.

There is no visible text in the image. The image’s composition and subject matter indicate it might be part of an annual development report focusing on community engagement, women's participation, or health initiatives.
```
![Image 1](images/2022TrustFundAnnualReports_p45_img1.png)

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image depicts a corner of a white sheet of paper partially curled upward from the bottom right corner, revealing a black background underneath. The paper appears blank with no visible text, images, or markings on the visible portion. The curling effect suggests a turning page or a reveal, fitting for an annual development report where content might be introduced or unveiled progressively. The layout focuses solely on this single element against the black backdrop, with no additional visual or textual components present.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a section of a printed document, likely part of an annual development report, as you mentioned.

Layout and Key Elements:
- On the left side, there is a photo of a young girl, smiling and wearing a yellow headscarf and blue shirt, holding what seems to be a small plant or sapling.
- Adjacent to the photo, on the right side, there is a text block with a purple background filled with white text.
- Above the photo, there is a heading in bold at the top of the text block.

Text:
The heading reads: "BUILDING RESILIENT FUTURES"

Below the heading, the main text says:
"Over the past year, our programs have reached over 10,000 children through education and health initiatives. Each child represents a promise—a future filled with hope and opportunity. We strive to provide support that not only addresses immediate needs but also builds lasting change within communities. Our focus remains on empowering families to create sustainable, thriving environments for generations to come."

At the bottom right, the text says:
"ANNUAL DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2023"

Summary:
The visual arrangement combines emotional appeal through the image of a hopeful child with impactful text emphasizing the organization's commitment to long-term, positive change. The purple background for the text makes the white font stand out clearly, enhancing readability.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a group of school children outside, with some walking and others using wheelchairs. They are all wearing matching school uniforms consisting of blue shirts, dark blue pants, and striped ties. In the foreground, a girl in a wheelchair is holding the hand of a boy walking beside her, while another boy pushes a different child in a wheelchair. Both the children in wheelchairs and those walking appear to be interacting and happy. 

The background includes more children, a yellow school bus, some greenery, and a small truck labeled "TATA." There is no visible text in the image itself, but the context suggests it is highlighting inclusivity and accessibility in education as part of an annual development report. The atmosphere is lively and positive, emphasizing togetherness and support among students with diverse mobility needs.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a group of schoolgirls sitting closely together indoors, all wearing blue and white school uniforms. Most of the girls have face masks either on or lowered under their chins. The girl in the center is smiling directly at the camera, drawing the viewer's attention. The background features several other students, slightly out of focus, indicating a larger group or classroom setting. 

There is no visible text in the image. The layout captures a candid moment emphasizing education and possibly health precautions given the presence of masks. This image could effectively support themes of youth education, school attendance, community, and resilience in an annual development report.
```

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a single sheet of paper with the top right corner slightly curled down, revealing the backside of the paper. The paper is mostly blank and white, set against a solid black background. There is no visible text or other key elements on the paper itself. The overall composition suggests a clean and minimalistic design, possibly signaling a page that is about to be turned or revealing new content underneath, which could fit well as a visual metaphor in an annual development report.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image depicts a busy street scene in what appears to be a commercial or market area. The layout shows a narrow road with multiple motorbikes and scooters traveling through it. Several people are riding these vehicles; some wear helmets, while others do not. On the left side of the road, there is a rickshaw carrying passengers adorned with flowers.

The right side of the image features a row of shops or stalls with various colorful textiles and garments hanging outside for display. People are standing near the shops, either shopping or walking along the sidewalk. The shop signs and banners are prominently displayed above the entrances, including a visible sign for "COZY SPA Body & Beauty Care Center." Another sign reads "Tibet House" with contact information underneath.

Overall, the key elements include:
- A busy street crowded with motorbikes, scooters, and a rickshaw.
- Colorful textile and garment shops on the right.
- Pedestrians walking or browsing near the shops.
- Multiple commercial signs with business names and services.

This scene captures an active urban marketplace with transportation and commerce intertwined.

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a curved page corner being peeled back, revealing the underside of the page. The background is black, and the page is white or light gray with a subtle shadow effect to enhance the curled appearance. There is no visible text or other elements on the page or in the background. The overall composition suggests a transition or a reveal, which could be used in an annual development report to symbolize looking forward or uncovering new information.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a serene natural landscape featuring a dense cluster of trees with lush green foliage. The trees occupy the mid to upper section of the image and have tall, slender trunks with broad canopies that allow patches of blue sky and white clouds to be visible through the leaves. In the foreground, there is an area covered with green shrubbery or low-lying plants.

There is no visible text in the image. The layout emphasizes the natural environment and woodland scene, making it suitable for inclusion in topics related to forestry, environment, or ecological development in an annual report. The overall feel of the image is peaceful and vibrant with greenery.

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a single sheet of paper with a slight curl at the top right corner, revealing the backside. The paper appears mostly blank from the front side shown, with no visible text, images, or other design elements. 

Since this is part of an annual development report, the image might serve as a placeholder or introductory page but does not contain any content or key elements within the visible area itself.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image features a modern, multi-story office building with a clean, white and black facade. The building is set against a background of a partly cloudy sky. In front of the building, there is a well-maintained grassy area with some plants and a paved walkway.

To the right of the building image, there is black text aligned vertically along the right margin of the page. The text reads:

"2018 Annual Report

Development Portfolio & Progress

Amaravati Project"

The overall layout balances the building photo on the left and the text on the right, likely indicating a focus on construction or development accomplishments within the annual report. The image and text are visually separated but cohesively designed to highlight the project's theme.

**Image 1 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a group of six women seated at a table, appearing to be engaged in a meeting or discussion. Most of the women are wearing headscarves in various styles and colors. One woman, second from the left, is wearing a face mask. They all seem attentive, with a few taking notes or holding pens.

In the background, there is a large poster or chart with text and images, which is partially visible. The text is not entirely legible, but it appears to be in the Cyrillic script or a related alphabet, suggesting a language like Russian or a Central Asian language.

On the far right side of the image, a flag is visible, displaying three horizontal stripes in red, white, and green with a gold emblem or design across the top white stripe. This flag resembles that of Tajikistan.

Overall, the setting appears to be a formal or semi-formal meeting, possibly related to community, governmental, or organizational work, as part of an annual development report context.
```

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image depicts a single sheet of paper with its top-right corner being curled or folded over, revealing the blank back side of the page. The visible portion of the front side is mostly blank and white, with no text, images, or other markings present. The curled corner creates a small triangular shadow, adding depth to the image. 

Overall, the layout is very minimal, showing just an empty page with a turned corner, possibly symbolizing a new beginning or a fresh page in the context of an annual development report. There are no key elements or text within the image itself.

**Image Description:**
The image shows a woman wearing a blue safety helmet and a black t-shirt, kneeling on the ground and working with electrical equipment. She is handling wires and components with focus and care. The equipment includes a blue device and other small instruments, possibly a multimeter or testing tools, with various cables connected.

The background features a patterned fabric hanging and a window or wall with bars and colorful panels.

There is no visible text in the image. The scene conveys a practical, technical activity, possibly related to electrical work or engineering, suggesting hands-on skill development or vocational training. This image fits well in an annual development report highlighting women's empowerment, technical skills training, or infrastructure development.
```

**Image 2 OCR + Description:**
```
**Image Description:**
The image shows a simple, minimalistic graphic of a single page with its top-right corner curled downwards, revealing the blank backside of the page. The background is completely black, providing a stark contrast to the white page. There is no text, image, or additional elements visible on the page itself. 

This style is often used to indicate page-turning or to symbolize the start of new content, fitting for a development report where information or data might be presented page by page.

**Image Description:**
The image features an upward view of a damaged multi-story brick building with several windows missing or broken. The upper parts of the building show signs of structural damage, including exposed framework and debris. In the foreground, prominently placed and in sharp focus, are bright yellow sunflowers with vibrant green leaves. The contrast between the lively sunflowers and the damaged building creates a powerful visual juxtaposition.

There is no text present in the image. The visual elements alone convey themes likely relevant to an annual development report—perhaps resilience, renewal, or hope amid destruction or hardship.

Foreword
We are at a critical moment in history. The world faces a perfect storm of intertwined and complex global challenges. 
For the world’s developing countries, the lingering effects of the global pandemic, slowing growth, conflict, fragility, 
food insecurity, and the urgent climate crisis all threaten to unwind development gains and plunge as many as 95 
million more people into poverty. 
The World Bank is transforming to respond to these compounding crises—fighting to preserve the hard-won 
development gains of previous decades and evolving to be a better partner to meet the most pressing needs of 
people and the planet in the future. Trust funds and financial intermediary funds (FIFs) are powerful tools for global 
development and an important part of this equation.
Trust funds and FIFs complement the World Bank’s core funding to meet critical needs, working across the 
development spectrum and delivering on the World Bank’s global challenge programs. Trust funds and FIFs have 
a powerful multiplier effect by targeting resources to issues of global concern, piloting innovative solutions for the 
most entrenched problems, developing knowledge that drives results, and allowing the World Bank to respond with 
urgency and in places otherwise out of reach.  
The evolution of the World Bank’s mission is an opportunity to further strengthen the impact of trust funds and 
FIFs. The reforms of the past five years have resulted in fewer, larger, and more strategically aligned trust funds, 
positioning them to meet this moment as they provide an established pathway for the World Bank to expand 
partnerships to increase available funds and impact. 
Partnerships play a crucial role in the success of the World Bank. Nowhere is that more prevalent than in trust funds 
and FIFs. We express gratitude to all our development partners, implementing partners, and client countries for 
their active involvement, cooperation, and commitment to our common mission and vision. As we work collectively 
to catalyze change and multiply impact in the face of cascading global crises, trust funds and FIFs are an integral 
component of the effort to end poverty and boost shared prosperity on a livable planet.

Trust Funds and FIFs at a Glance  |  IV
World Bank trust funds are financial instruments that create partnerships and platforms 
for financial, knowledge, and other collaborations around the world and across every area of 
development. They accept contributions from one or more donors and are held and disbursed 
by the World Bank as a trustee. Trust funds represent important funding sources for both clients 
and the World Bank. 
Financial intermediary funds (FIFs) are customized platforms for partnership programs and 
special financing mechanisms. They provide large-scale commingled funding through multiple 
implementing entities to address core development challenges. FIFs are typically governed by 
an independent board, with the World Bank serving as a limited trustee or treasury manager of 
26 FIFs and an implementing entity of 20.

**Image Description:**
The image features a close-up view of four sunflowers, focusing primarily on their yellow petals and large brown centers. The sunflowers are positioned prominently in the foreground, with one flower facing directly toward the right, showing its full face, while the other three are shown from the side or back, aligned diagonally from the bottom left to the upper right of the image.

In the background, there are dilapidated, weathered buildings that appear to be abandoned or in ruins, contrasting sharply with the vibrant, lively sunflowers. The sky above is cloudy and overcast, adding a somber tone to the scene.

There is no visible text in the image. The overall layout draws attention to the juxtaposition between the beauty of nature (the sunflowers) and urban decay (the ruined buildings), which could symbolize themes of resilience, hope, and renewal in the context of an annual development report.

The world has suffered concurrent crises and 
formidable global challenges that have devastated 
many of the least developed economies and the most 
vulnerable communities. The compounding effects of 
poverty, pandemics, climate change, debt, conflict, 
food insecurity, and fragility threaten to undo decades 
of hard-won development gains. The stakes could not 
be higher—nearly 700 million people live in extreme 
poverty, and almost half the world’s population live 
on less than $6.85 a day.1 Urgent calls from across 
the international community demand that radically 
reformed and strengthened multilateral development 
banks (MDBs) led by the World Bank address these 
challenges head-on. 
The World Bank is implementing a new playbook 
committed to creating a world free of poverty on a 
livable planet. Focusing on eight global challenges 
(Box 1.1), the Bank aims to end extreme poverty and 
boost shared prosperity on a livable planet by providing 
solutions to support country priorities, address global 
challenges through country programming, and drive 
development with speed, scale, and impact. This new 
mission builds on the Bank’s country-based model 
while retrofitting its operational and financial modalities 
to mobilize more co-financing for development. Trust 
funds and financial intermediary funds (FIFs) play an 
important role in this evolution.
Trust funds and FIFs are powerful tools for global 
development. They represent some of the best 
cooperation, 
commitment, 
and 
action 
of 
the 
international community to address the world’s most 
pressing problems. They help advance progress on 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 
policy and investment priorities of middle and low-
income countries. Trust funds and FIFs are flexible, 
responsive tools in the World Bank’s comprehensive 
toolkit of policy and financial instruments, bringing 
both complementarity to Bank operations and 
targeted and customized solutions (Box 1.2).

By creating a platform for innovation, trust funds and 
FIFs often have a catalytic, outsized impact on global 
development. The highly concessionary financial 
resources provided by these instruments co-finance 
both IBRD loans and IDA credits, which helps soften 
terms for borrowing countries and makes it easier to 
pilot innovative solutions by de-risking investments 
in an efficient manner. These resources encourage 
experimentation, make space to pilot and scale up 
projects, and generate global public goods in which 
borrowing countries may be unwilling to invest without 
incentives to do so. 
Trust funds and FIFs offer tremendous flexibility. 
The tractability of trust funds, in allocation and 
implementation, enables the Bank to rapidly respond 
in times of crisis and remain engaged, especially in 
places where core lending activity is complicated. 
The flexible design of FIFs enables funds to be raised 
from multiple sources and channeled in a coordinated 
manner to address global priorities.
Trust funds and FIFs are engines of knowledge, 
contributing to a wide variety of IBRD and IDA 
projects implemented by recipients. They enable 
countries to obtain technical assistance, expertise, 
and analytics to support national development, as 
well as the administrative, knowledge, and advisory 
services provided by the World Bank staff to support 
client needs, project preparation and implementation, 
and wide-ranging global public goods. 
The World Bank’s private sector arm IFC also uses 
trust fund and FIF resources to unlock private 
sector finance for development, by establishing 
credible standards for investors, enabling financial 
innovation, and mobilizing private capital beyond 
IFC’s own account. Trust funds and FIFs support 
IFC’s continuum of expertise, ranging from analytics 
and diagnostics to advisory and to game-changing 
investment opportunities that stimulate greater private 
sector investments. 
MIGA, the World Bank’s political risk insurance 
and credit enhancement arm, also works with 
development partners to leverage its resources 
and increase the risk appetite of private investors 
in challenging environments. By collaborating with 
development 
partners 
to 
establish 
specialized 
guarantee trust funds, MIGA mobilizes guarantee 
capacity in high-risk states affected by fragility, conflict, 
and violence (FCV), where its operations would 
be limited.

The Many Benefits of Trust Funds and FIFs 
BOX

The World Bank is a partner of choice for trust 
funds and FIFs. Of the 26 FIFs that the World Bank 
administrates, 18 chose to have the Bank host their 
secretariat and 20 use the Bank as an implementing 
entity. During the last five years (fiscal 2019–23), the 
World Bank has implemented $4.4 billion from these 
20 FIFs, representing 29 percent of their total funding 
provided to recipient countries and regions around the 
world. For many FIFs, the World Bank is their largest 
implementing entity.
As trustee of trust funds and FIFs under its 
management, the World Bank takes its fiduciary 
obligation seriously. It provides regular reports to 
development partners on the progress of funded 
activities and the use of trust funds, as agreed in 
legal agreements. The Bank provides a management 
assertion and an attestation from external auditors 
regarding internal controls over cash-based financial 
reporting for all cash-based trust funds, along with a 
combined financial statement for these trust funds, 
and the auditor's opinion on them.
When the World Bank engages in a trust-funded 
program, it is not simply an administrator for the 
contributing donors. Rather, the Bank brings all its 
institutional capacities to bear to achieve shared 
objectives more efficiently than one partner could 
achieve by itself. The Bank is a thought leader with 
deep technical expertise and knowledge and a 
trusted source of development data and analysis. Its 
global reach, country presence, and central place in 
international development networks mean the Bank 
can convene partners across sectors and geographic 
locations to facilitate consensus on approaches to key 
development issues and then activate operations on 
the ground. These abilities and attributes ensure trust 
fund and FIF funding is used strategically to maximize 
coordinated action and achieve impact at scale.
Nowhere has the value of trust fund partnerships been 
more evident in fiscal 2023 than in Ukraine. Since 
Russia’s invasion in February 2022, the World Bank 
and other development partners have mobilized more 
than $37.5 billion—over half of which, $19.5 billion, 
has been disbursed through World Bank trust funds.2 
Support for Ukraine is largely responsible for the 
jump in total IBRD/IDA trust fund contributions and 
disbursements, which went from $4.9 billion and $5.6 
billion, respectively, in fiscal 2022 to $22.3 billion and 
$20.7 billion, respectively, in fiscal 2023.

New trust funds were set up to deliver fast-
disbursing, targeted funding to assist the people of 
Ukraine with their immediate needs, keep institutions 
and services running, and enable wider recovery 
and reconstruction efforts. The World Bank has 
since established the Multi-Donor Resources for 
Institutions and Infrastructure (MRII) Facility 
to coordinate IBRD/IDA, IFC, and MIGA support 
for Ukraine, including trust-funded initiatives. The 
facility takes a phased and multi-pronged approach 
to mobilizing financing and coordinating resources 
through guarantees, co- and parallel financing, and 
other financial instruments. 
Trust funds also enable international aid to flow to 
Afghanistan. Since the country’s abrupt change 
of government in August 2021, the Afghanistan 
Resilience Trust Fund (ARTF) has served as the 
central partnership platform from which the Bank has 
coordinated with development partners and donors 
and committed over $1 billion in off-budget support 
for the Afghan people. United Nations agencies and 
the Aga Khan Foundation implement ARTF-funded 
operations to deliver critical health, livelihood, food, 
water, and education services, as well as to collect 
and analyze data on current conditions within 
households and communities to inform humanitarian 
and development aid.
Pooled funding and partnership platforms have 
become a common development approach in 
conflict-affected, crisis, and reconstruction situations. 
Engagement with partners with on-the-ground

been critical in delivering services for health and 
food security in hard-to-reach areas of Somalia 
and South Sudan. Engagement with these partners 
improves development partner coordination and 
harmonization of objectives, joint leverage in dialogue 
with government, impact, and efficiency. It dilutes 
exposure to political and reputational risks, increases 
funding predictability, and promotes robust fiduciary 
and monitoring frameworks.
International cooperation has also been essential for 
responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, with trust 
funds and FIFs playing important roles in saving 
lives, protecting the poor, maintaining education 
continuity, ensuring sustainable business growth and 
job creation, and strengthening policies, institutions, 
and investments. In the wake of the pandemic, trust-
funded research and analysis by the World Bank have 
helped cities, countries, and regions worldwide assess 
their COVID-19 response and institute reforms to build 
resilience against future pandemics by strengthening 
health care systems, vaccination protocols, and 
community outreach. 
In fiscal 2023, the World Bank used its convening 
power, knowledge, and experience to bring together 
G20 members, the World Health Organization, MDBs, 
global health institutions, and civil society to establish 
the Pandemic Fund. This new FIF answers the global 
call to augment the existing health security financing 
system and mobilize additional resources to build 
health systems and strengthen pandemic prevention, 
preparedness, and response capabilities in low and 
middle-income countries. It has raised $2 billion in 
initial contributions and issued its first call for proposals 
in February 2023. 
Also ready for action is the Scaling Climate Action 
by Lowering Emissions (SCALE) multi-partner 
umbrella trust fund initiated in fiscal 2023. The amount 
of resources required to combat climate change is 
immense, and the World Bank is working on many 
fronts to expand climate finance opportunities. SCALE 
builds on the Bank’s 20 years of experience with 
projects that generate high-quality, high-integrity 
emission reduction credits using results-based climate 
finance. This new umbrella program will pool funding 
from the global community, including donor countries, 
the private sector, and foundations, and make it 
available for the most impactful programs that reduce 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Technical advice 
and capacity strengthening provided by SCALE will 
also help countries gain the tools, knowledge, and 
experience they need to access additional private 
sector finance through international carbon markets. 
This report sheds light on these and many more trust 
fund programs that contribute to World Bank-led 
responses to overlapping global challenges, with a 
focus on climate change, pandemics, FCV, and the 
financial instability they engender. While the chapters 
are distinct, these four focus areas intersect and bring 
in other global challenges, such as energy access, 
food and nutrition security, water security and access, 
enabling digitalization, and protecting biodiversity 
and nature. 
The 52 trust-funded activities featured in this report 
and the supplemental 2023 Yearbook of Trust-
funded Results cover a five-year period from fiscal 
2019–23. These impactful activities demonstrate the 
interconnectedness of the challenges—and their 
solutions—and show how trust fund partnerships 
benefit the World Bank, its clients, and its development 
partners. For example:
• Analysis and mapping of groundwater-
dependent ecosystems in the Sahel supported 
by the Cooperation in International Waters 
in Africa (CIWA) induced countries in the 
region to initiate reforms to protect these 
essential carbon sinks, vital to rural economies, 
livelihoods, and biodiversity.
• IFC trust funds helped advance a public-
private partnership in India to develop eight 
solar power parks totaling 1,500 megawatts 
and expected to reduce 2.8 million tons of GHG 
emissions annually.

• World Bank-led research funded by the 
Global Program for the Blue Economy 
(PROBLUE) informs industry players in 
international maritime shipping on ways to 
harness the unique business and development 
opportunities that decarbonizing the 
sector provides.
• Advice and analysis funded by Food Systems 
2030 helped lay the groundwork for regional 
cooperation in Central Asia on pandemic 
preparedness that prioritizes zoonoses, 
antimicrobial resistance, and food safety.
• Co-financing from the Global Agriculture 
and Food Security Program (GAFSP) helps 
West African countries build regional capacity 
to manage agricultural and food insecurity 
risks through more productive climate-
smart agricultural practices and increased 
intraregional trade.
• IFC trust funds helped smooth the way for 
digital data corridors among credit bureaus in 
Eastern Europe, enabling Ukrainian refugees 
to verify their identities and credit histories 
electronically so they can gain access to 
finance in host countries.

• Each umbrella program is anchored by a primary, or anchor, multi-donor trust fund and may include 
associated trust funds. 
• A single governance structure for all funds in a program—the Partnership Council—brings the 
World Bank’s management and partners to the same table around common development 
objectives, helps avoid fragmentation of resources, and increases efficiency. 
• The Partnership Council endorses the umbrella program’s annual work program and budget after 
which the World Bank allocates program resources to individual activities. 
• A unified results framework for each umbrella program is developed in consultation with 
development partners and covers activities funded by all trust funds in a program. It is the 
key monitoring tool to assess how individual activities are contributing to a program’s overall 
development objectives. The Partnership Council reviews progress against the unified 
results framework.
• Unified reporting is implemented at the program level with a strong focus on results.
• A communication and visibility plan for each umbrella program ensures that its strategic 
communication needs are considered and implemented.
Key Features and Principles of Umbrella 2.0 Programs 
BOX
1.3
1.1 Managing Trust Funds 
and FIFs 
Across the World Bank, trust funds and FIFs are 
managed so that their financing can be mobilized 
with speed and efficiency (Table 1.1). Trust fund 
management 
arrangements 
are 
designed 
to 
enhance strategic alignment and to promote 
strong internal oversight and risk management, 
streamlined processes, and effective collaboration on 
establishing development priorities among the Bank, 
development partners, and client countries. The 
World Bank also provides administrative, operational, 
legal, and financial services to a diverse portfolio of 
FIFs and, in many cases, acts as an implementing 
entity (Annex E).
Since 2020, the World Bank has worked to transition 
from a fragmented portfolio of IBRD/IDA trust fund 
accounts to 72 larger and more strategically aligned 
Umbrella 2.0 Programs (Annex C). These programs, 
developed in consultation with the Bank’s major 
donors, seek to promote good oversight, greater 
efficiency, and results reporting (Box 1.3). Reforms 
have streamlined and harmonized governance and 
management processes for better engagement, 
transparency, and integration with the Bank’s strategy 
and planning processes while reducing transaction 
costs for mutual benefit. 
By targeting donor resources through fewer and 
larger umbrella programs, the World Bank is reducing 
its trust fund portfolio to strengthen the link between 
financing and strategic priorities. Better-focused, more 
consolidated umbrella programs complement the 
Bank's core instruments and align with its country-
driven model. They support programmatic approaches 
for addressing global priorities and global public 
goods, enable analytical and advisory work, and pilot 
approaches for later uptake under core instruments.


## Page 17

UPDATE ON TRUST FUND REFORMS
Continued engagement across the World Bank’s 
Global Practices and Regions has maintained internal 
momentum on the reforms. During fiscal 2023, four 
new umbrella programs were added and two were 
dropped resulting in a total of 72 umbrella programs, 
of which 62 are up and running. Standalone trust funds 
have been reduced by 41 percent since the baseline, 
decreasing the number to 275 at the end of fiscal 2023 
(Table 1.1).
The reforms have now entered their next phase to 
further improve the use of trust funds, including 
upstream integration of trust fund resources with the 
World Bank’s business planning processes. This is 
possible because donors in umbrella programs are 
more focused at a strategic level, enabling the Bank 
to take funding decisions for individual activities 
and projects.
In fiscal 2023, an early consultation and clearance 
process on the use of global funds at the country 
level was put in place to improve trust funds’ global-
to-country linkages. A new internal information 
platform was launched to help Bank teams working 
in operations more easily access information on 
potential umbrella program funding, whether global, 
regional, or country. 
The Bank has also started developing a more 
harmonized approach to the process of allocating 
trust fund resources in line with key principles of 
ensuring transparency, efficiency, strategic alignment, 
and management oversight. Once implemented, 
this will reduce the unnecessarily wide diversity of 
practices and support internal efficiency, oversight, 
and the integration of trust funds into the Bank’s 
business planning cycle for better whole-of-finance 
decision making.
STRATEGIC FUNDRAISING 
The annual Strategic External Funds Framework 
(SEFF) exercise supports the Bank’s management 
in furthering the evolution to a more strategy-driven 
approach to fundraising and authorizing changes 
in the trust fund portfolio architecture. The fiscal 
2023 exercise consolidated progress made in the 
shift to a streamlined umbrella trust fund portfolio 
architecture and allowed for Bank management to 
review fundraising plans and ensure their alignment 
with priorities. Further, it helped confirm the realism of 
the fundraising plan for fiscal years 2024–26. Based on 
the plans laid out in the SEFF, 89 percent of trust fund 
fundraising will target umbrella programs.

Note: Standalone trust funds are those established by a World Bank business unit outside of an umbrella program. Standalone 
co-financing trust funds are trustee-level trust funds established for the sole purpose of co-financing an IDA or IBRD operation.

IBRD/IDA
IFC
In 2023, the process continued to transition 
from a fragmented portfolio of trust fund 
accounts to 72 larger and more strategically 
aligned Umbrella 2.0 Programs (Annex C).
• Umbrella programs offer strategic 
alignment and stronger internal 
oversight, reduced transaction costs, 
and better integration with the Bank's 
strategy and planning processes. 
• Streamlined, harmonized governance 
and management processes facilitate 
better engagement, transparency, and 
risk management. 
• Increased focus on results reporting and 
communications aims to boost visibility.
• 89% of trust fund fundraising targets 
umbrella programs.
In 2023, IFC updated several key trust fund 
policies and procedures:
• The IFC Trust Fund Directive was 
revised to consolidate the IFC policy 
framework regarding IFC Advisory 
and Blended Finance trust funds and 
introduce Upstream as a new segment 
of IFC work relying on development 
partner support.
• A modernized IFC Trust Fund 
Accreditation course was introduced 
to ensure operational and support staff 
have up-to-date information on IFC trust 
funds management. This mandatory 
training will reach approximately 1,000 
IFC staff.
• Reporting on trust-funded programs 
continues to be streamlined to 
enhance the quality of IFC donor 
reports while gaining efficiency in 
the reporting process.
MIGA
FIFs
In fiscal 2022, MIGA adopted the MIGA 
Strategic Priorities Program to streamline 
management of its five active multi-donor 
trust funds. 
• The program entails a common 
governance framework that provides 
unified governance, reporting, and 
oversight requirements.
• It has a consistent approach toward 
strategy, fundraising, and coordination 
to avoid duplication of trust fund 
activities. 
• It boosts MIGA’s ability to provide 
blended finance solutions and crowds 
in public and private reinsurance, where 
available, to deploy guarantees in 
support of its clients.
In fiscal 2023, the Bank served as limited 
trustee or treasury manager for 26 FIFs 
(Annex E). 
• FIF Management Framework, policies, 
and procedures were adopted to 
strengthen the selectivity, shaping, and 
oversight of FIFs as part of building a 
strategic global aid architecture. 
• Increased strategic engagement with 
development partners continued as 
part of ongoing efforts to shape the 
dialogue on new FIF proposals and the 
continuum of financing instruments 
available to meet development 
objectives.

Climate change reverberates across the globe, but 
low-income countries and vulnerable communities 
suffer the most despite contributing the least to carbon 
emissions. Left unchecked, climate change could 
push 132 million people into poverty over the next 10 
years, undoing hard-won development gains.3 It could 
drive 216 million people to migrate within their own 
countries by 2050, with hotspots of internal migration 
emerging as soon as 2030.4 Extreme weather events 
caused by a changing climate have already severely 
strained crop yields and are expected to further 
damage global food supplies, especially in the world’s 
most food-insecure regions. GHG emissions that 
cause global warming continue to grow, and the world 
is not on track to meet net zero by 2050.5 
Tackling climate change is urgent and fundamental to 
the fight against poverty. The World Bank is the largest 
multilateral financier of climate action in developing 
countries. It delivered a record $38.6 billion in climate 
finance in fiscal 2023, a 22 percent increase from 
last year. Guided by its Climate Change Action Plan 
2021–2025, the Bank is mainstreaming climate into 
all its development work, ensuring that by 2025 
everything it does is aligned with the objectives of the 
Paris Agreement. 
The Bank helps countries most affected by the climate 
crisis turn their national plans, policy priorities, and 
other climate ambitions into meaningful action on 
reducing or preventing GHG emissions (mitigation) 
and adjusting to unavoidable consequences of climate 
change (adaptation). It works with both the public and 
private sectors to implement policy and regulatory 
reforms and to create incentives for investments that 
can mitigate climate change, as well as help countries 
adapt to it. Well managed, a just transition to low-
carbon development can usher in an era of green 
growth with more and better jobs, greater economic 
and climate resilience, and greater equality and 
shared prosperity.
The World Bank’s commitments for climate-related 
investments reached 41 percent of total Bank financing 
in fiscal 2023.  IBRD and IDA together delivered $29.4 
billion in climate finance, of which almost $12 billion 
supported investments in adaptation and resilience. 
This brings the Bank closer to its goal of achieving 
parity between mitigation and adaptation financing. 
IFC, which delivered $7.6 billion in total climate 
finance in fiscal 2023, and MIGA, which provided 
$1.5 billion, also continue to step up efforts to identify 
private sector investment opportunities that enhance 
adaptation and resilience. 
Trust funds and FIFs are part of this push for increased 
climate action. They play an important role in the 
provision of concessional funding to scale up climate 
investments, help countries in their quest for climate 
adaptation, and incentivize faster decarbonization. 
The World Bank uses trust funds in tandem with its 
core financing, as well as with climate-related FIFs, 
to address global climate challenges and support 
countries’ sustainable development efforts. 
The volume of recipient-executed (RE) disbursements 
from IBRD/IDA trust funds going to climate and other 
environment-related activities has increased annually 
for the last five fiscal years of 2019–23 (Figure 2.1). 
Climate-related RE investments during this time 
frame totaled $2.5 billion, of which $1.4 billion, or 
56 percent, were for mitigation activities, and $1.1 
billion, or 44 percent, were for adaptation activities 
(Figure 2.2). Two-thirds of all RE climate-related 
disbursements, or $1.7 billion, were contributed by 
development partners, while the other one-third, 
or $0.8 billion, consisted of transfers from FIFs 
implemented by IBRD/IDA. 
Twelve of the 26 FIFs administered by the Bank focus 
on climate change and environmental issues. The 
Bank acts as an implementing entity for many of 
these FIFs, including the Global Environment Facility 
(GEF), the Climate Investment Funds (CIF), and the 
Green Climate Fund (GCF). These are the three 
largest climate-related FIFs, with the GEF providing 
concessional 
funding 
for 
environment-related 
activities more broadly, and CIF and the GCF focusing 
on climate change mitigation and adaptation.

2.1 Advancing Mitigation Efforts
The World Bank prioritizes mitigation activities in the 
following five systems, which together contribute 
over 90 percent of global GHG emissions: energy; 
agriculture, food, water, and land; cities; transport; 
and manufacturing. Transforming these systems is 
key to achieving Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDC)—emission reductions that countries pledge 
to achieve under the Paris Agreement—as well as 
countries’ development goals. Trust funds are part of 
these efforts.
For instance, given green hydrogen’s promise 
as a renewable energy source that could help 
decarbonize challenging sectors, such as mining 
and transport, a technical assistance grant to Chile 
from the Spanish Fund for Latin America and the 
Caribbean (SFLAC) has played a pivotal role in 
advancing the country’s National Green Hydrogen 
Strategy. The grant enabled the Bank to provide 
valuable knowledge and policy guidance, helping to 
position Chile as a regional leader in green hydrogen. 
Furthermore, it informed the preparation of a $150 
million IBRD project approved in June 2023 to 
support the creation of a Green Hydrogen Fund.
Energy sector transformation is also underway in 
Ukraine, despite Russia’s invasion. On March 16, 2022, 
the Ukrainian power system started synchronous 
operations with the power systems of the European 
Network of Transmission System Operators for 
Electricity (ENTSO-E) after disconnection from the 
Unified Power System of Russia. The World Bank 
utilized various trust funds to support this journey 
through project investments and technical assistance.6 
Ukraine now has access to a larger reserve of power 
and one of the world’s largest integrated electricity 
markets, to which Ukraine turned to improve its energy 
security after military attacks damaged more than half 
of its power infrastructure in late 2022. Over the long 
term, the synchronization will help Ukraine unlock 
trade opportunities with the European energy market 
and competition within the domestic market, as well 
as move toward sector decarbonization. A more 
flexible power system will allow greater integration of 
renewable energy sources, thereby lessening reliance 
on fossil fuels.
In India, IFC used trust funds7 to help advance a 
public-private partnership between Rewa Ultra 
Mega Solar Ltd. and the state government of Madhya 
Pradesh to develop eight solar power parks totaling 
1,500 megawatts and expected to reduce 2.8 million 
tons of GHG emissions annually. The advisory project, 
completed in fiscal 2023, not only resulted in some 
of the lowest solar tariffs in the state, but it also 
secured Indian Railways, one of the largest electricity 
consumers in the country, as a power procurer 
alongside the state power procurement entity, MP 
Power Management Company Limited. Having a 
captive, high-quality buyer has helped to de-risk the 
generation project, and it has created an opportunity 
for the largest railway network in Asia to reduce the 
carbon footprint of its train operations.
6 The trust funds involved were Bank-implemented financing from CIF’s Clean Technology Fund (CTF), the Ukraine Second 
Power Transmission Project Single-Donor Trust Fund, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), 
the Korea Green Growth Trust Fund (KGGTF).
7 The IFC trust funds involved were the Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade – IFC Global Advisory Services 
Trust Fund, and the Infrastructure Development Collaboration Partnership Fund (DEVCO).
With support, we will be able 
to establish a fund that will 
provide financing under favorable 
long-term conditions for the 
development of projects...
and support the development of
this industry.

decarbonization. The Global Facility to Decarbonize 
Transport (GFDT) supported the preparation of an 
IBRD project focused on traffic management and safe 
infrastructure for bicyclists and other non-motorized 
transport users in the capital Lima. GFDT-funded data 
and analysis helped to prioritize transport investments 
and inform bike lane design, traffic flow, street 
intersection safety, and capacity building for local 
transport planning agencies. The work will shape the 
next 10 years of the investment program and Lima’s 
urban transport planning efforts more broadly. It will 
also serve as a blueprint for Lima’s secondary cities 
and similar World Bank projects elsewhere.
With funding from the Global Program for the 
Blue Economy (PROBLUE) and in partnership with 
clients, sector specialists, and scientists, the World 
Bank led a series of reports on decarbonizing the 
international maritime shipping sector and harnessing 
the unique business and development opportunities it

The World Bank’s climate change mitigation work also 
includes helping countries boost their public domestic 
resources for climate action. Green taxes and fossil 
fuel subsidy reforms can help countries raise revenues 
while accelerating investments in renewables, but 
such measures are underutilized. With funding from 
the Global Tax Program (GTP), the World Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) developed the 
Climate Policy Assessment Tool (CPAT). Countries 
can use CPAT to design and assess climate-smart 
tax and subsidy reform options, such as carbon taxes, 
emissions trading systems, coal excise taxes, power 
feebates, electricity excises, electricity emissions, and 
renewable subsidies. The Bank has applied the tool in 
over 30 countries, contributing to development policy 
operations (DPOs) in two countries and several World 
Bank Country Climate and Development Reports.
2.2 Adapting and Building 
Resilience to Climate Impacts 
The World Bank helps countries around the world 
adapt and build resilience to the increasingly severe 
impacts of climate change so they can better prepare 
for and withstand climate shocks. The Bank has 
committed to ensuring that half of its climate finance 
supports adaptation and resilience. Trust funds 
contribute to this goal, building partnerships and 
delivering adaptation investments that benefit people 
and communities now and long into the future.
For example, the Global Facility for Disaster 
Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) supports World 
Bank collaboration with a range of UN agencies, 
governments, and other partners to help countries 
reduce disaster risk and losses from natural disasters. 
It also serves as the World Bank’s implementing entity 
for the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems 
Initiative (CREWS)—a FIF that invests in early 
warning systems to protect lives, livelihoods, and 
assets in least-developed countries and small island 
developing states (SIDS) that are most vulnerable to 
the impact of climate and extreme weather events. 
GFDRR enables a range of World Bank technical 
support and analytical tools, such as the Global 
Rapid Post-Disaster Damage Estimation (GRADE) 
deployed in the aftermath of recent floods in Pakistan. 
The assessment directly informed the recovery 
operations and helped leverage $1.7 billion of World 
Bank financing. In Chad, the GFDRR-backed Nature-
Based Solutions Opportunity Scan identified areas in 
which nature-based solutions could reduce pluvial 
and fluvial flood risks and address urban heat in the 
capital city. This led to a $150 million IDA investment 
in N’Djamena’s urban resilience. 
Nigeria has benefitted from Bank-implemented 
funding from the Global Environment Facility 
(GEF) and its Special Climate Change Fund 
to better handle disaster risks related to erosion. 
The Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management 
Project (NEWMAP) helped to reduce soil erosion in 
targeted sub-watersheds across 23 states through 
an integrated watershed management approach. 
Some 12 million people have benefited from 
reconnected transport corridors, better access to 
markets and services, reduced flooding and siltation, 
improved storm water planning, and improved disaster 
risk preparedness.
From too much water to not enough, trust-funded 
activities help countries cope with water scarcity 
made worse by climate change. Groundwater is a 
vital freshwater resource worldwide, particularly 
in times of drought. As climate change worsens, 
policymakers need to better understand and manage 
this critical asset. The Global Water Security and 
Sanitation Partnership (GWSP) funded a new 
World Bank global flagship report entitled, The Hidden 
Wealth of Nations: The Economics of Groundwater in 
Times of Climate Change. It considers the economic 
value of groundwater, the costs of misusing it, and 
the opportunities to leverage it more effectively. The 
report offers new data and evidence to help prioritize 
groundwater across sectors and at the highest 
political level.

Governments of several countries in the Sahel 
have initiated institutional reforms to improve the 
management 
of 
their 
groundwater 
resources, 
thanks to research funded by the Cooperation in 
International Waters in Africa (CIWA) through 
the Sahel Groundwater Initiative. Analysis of the 
challenges of groundwater management in the 
region underscores the importance of this natural 
resource as a buffer against increasing water stress 
in arid lands and proposes a first typology of Sahelian 
groundwater-dependent ecosystems. 
Climate adaptation and resilience measures demand 
high-level political action, but also local community 
buy-in. In Samoa, the World Bank implemented a 
$14.6 million project financed by CIF’s Pilot Program 
for Climate Resilience (PPCR) that built on the 
governance embedded within traditional community 
structures to integrate climate risk and resilience into 
core development planning. Communities prioritized 
adaptation investments to protect coastal resources 
The project has not only benefitted 
our villages and district communities 
but also civil society and the private 
sector. We have started to build 
community resilience to climate 
change to deal with multiple shocks.

Community engagement is central to Mozambique’s 
Conservation Areas for Biodiversity and Development 
Project (MozBio), supported by the GEF and the 
multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) for Integrated 
Landscape Management (ILM) in Mozambique. 
Recognizing that the inclusion of women in natural 
resource management and their equal participation 
in economic and social life are essential for 
enhanced resilience, MozBio has worked closely 
with partners on gender balancing and piloting the 
Gender Action Learning System (GALS). More than 
1,000 beneficiaries have been guided through this 
step-by-step household methodology to identify and 
overcome gender barriers to economic and social 
progress. The project also supports area schools in 
implementing an environmental curriculum to raise 
youth awareness and engagement in preserving 
Mozambique’s biodiversity.
2.3 Accessing Carbon Markets 
Carbon markets could be a major source of additional 
revenue for climate action, reaching $50 billion a year 
by 2030 by some estimates.8 Market structures taking 
shape under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement hold a 
great deal of promise for incentivizing decarbonization 
efforts. Since the launch of the Clean Development 
Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol over 20 
years ago, the World Bank has worked with partners to 
create a full-fledged carbon market ecosystem—from 
setting standards for methodologies and requirements 
for third-party validation, to verification and reporting, 
to benefit-sharing arrangements so proceeds go to 
communities involved in reducing emissions.
World Bank trust funds have played a strategic role in 
this work, piloting results-based climate and carbon 
finance mechanisms that deliver payments once pre-
agreed targets have been achieved—namely, verified

McKinsey Sustainability.
emission reductions (or carbon credits) that meet 
the World Bank’s highest environmental, accounting, 
and social inclusion standards. The promise of future 
payout is a strong incentive for action on the ground, 
and payments signal to other potential investors and 
buyers that real progress is being made in reducing 
emissions. To ensure success, trust funds provide 
technical assistance and capacity building so 
stakeholders have the necessary tools and training 
to generate, verify, and monetize their emission 
reductions. The process enables countries to build the 
expertise and systems needed to access international 
and regional carbon markets and sell excess carbon 
credits over the long term.
Building on these two decades of experience, the 
World Bank is preparing to roll out its new Scaling 
Climate Action by Lowering Emissions (SCALE) 
umbrella multi-partner trust fund. SCALE brings 
together all results-based climate and carbon financing 
programs currently housed at the World Bank into a 
one-stop-shop. It is designed to complement up-front 
activity-based finance with results-based payments of 
$40-60 million per project, supporting decarbonization 
across a broad range of sectors. SCALE also provides 
technical advice and capacity building and serves 
as an instrument for policy dialogue and broader 
engagement to incentivize low-carbon development. 
In addition, SCALE’s benefit-sharing arrangements 
are designed with broad stakeholder consultation 
to ensure that all project participants, including 
Indigenous Peoples and local communities, are 
recognized and rewarded for their role in driving 
low-carbon transitions. The Enhancing Access to 
Benefits while Lowering Emissions (EnABLE) 
MDTF will work in tandem with SCALE to further 
promote social inclusion of marginalized communities 
and disadvantaged groups, such as women, youth, 
and people with disabilities.

Looking back over the last five years, the following 
trust-funded activities offer insight into the power 
and potential of results-based payments to stimulate 
greater and faster decarbonization in a variety of 
settings and sectors.
For example, in Brazil, the Carbon Partnership 
Facility (CPF) worked with the country’s second-
largest public bank, CAIXA, to provide financing to 
incentivize reductions in methane emissions from 
decomposing trash. Methane is a powerful GHG and 
the second-largest driver of global climate change. The 
world’s cities generate more than a billion tons of solid 
waste each year. Under this project, improvements to 
four landfills generated emission reduction payments 
of €23.7 million between 2013 and 2020, and captured 
over 175 million cubic meters of methane, equivalent 
to 3.5 million tons of CO2 emissions. 
Supported by $18 million in grants from the 
BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest 
Landscapes (ISFL), Ethiopia’s Oromia Forested 
Landscape Program combines agriculture, livestock, 
and forestry to address climate change at the 
landscape level. By targeting the Oromia region, home 
to over 30 million people and 52 percent of Ethiopia's 
forests, the program plays a central role in advancing 
the country's climate resilience agenda. In February 
2023, a milestone was met with the signing of an 
Emission Reductions Purchase Agreement (ERPA). 
ISFL agrees to pay up to $40 million for the reduction 
of approximately 4 million tonnes of GHG emissions 
by 2030 through forest preservation and sustainable 
land management practices in the program area. 
Our village is no longer 
threatened by deforestation. We 
are reforesting the bare lands and 
sustainably managing the existing 
ones. We have seen how the 
microclimate is changing and the 
income-generating activities are 
benefiting us.

The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) 
has also signed ERPAs with 15 countries, including 
Indonesia. For over a decade, the FCPF has supported 
Indonesia in developing its first-ever jurisdictional-level 
program for reducing emissions from deforestation 
and forest degradation (REDD+), including signing an 
ERPA to uphold the program’s implementation. The 
FCPF will pay $110 million for the reduction of 22 million 
tons of GHG emissions across 12.7 million hectares 
of land rich in tropical rainforests and biodiversity. 
In fiscal 2023, Indonesia received an advance ERPA 
payment of $20.9 million, which represents 14 percent 
of the value of the emission reductions reported in the 
government’s monitoring report for the 2019–2020 
crediting period. With the FCPF, the government is 
exploring various carbon finance scenarios, including 
carbon markets and a domestic carbon exchange, as 
it expects to generate excess emission reductions. 
While carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris 
Agreement have the potential to unlock climate 
finance, they will only be effective in limiting 
global warming if the carbon credits transacted 
are real, credible, and accurately accounted for 
and tracked. The Carbon Finance Assist Trust 
Fund (Carbon-Assist) and the Partnership for 
Market Implementation Facility (PMIF) helped 
finance the development of the Climate Action 
Data (CAD) Trust, an open-source global platform 
that connects, aggregates, and harmonizes carbon 
credit data. CAD Trust enhances transparency 
and trust in carbon markets by harmonizing data 
formats and connecting disparate carbon registry 
systems. The Government of Singapore and the 
International Emissions Trading Association also 
support the platform, whose overarching goal is to 
strengthen reporting compliance requirements and 
implementation of NDCs.
2.4 Incentivizing 
the Private Sector 
The private sector has a key role to play in helping 
address the climate challenge, as economic stresses 
and multiple crises strain the ability of governments to 
make the necessary investments to mitigate and adapt 
to climate change. With the support of trust funds, the 
World Bank offers climate expertise across industries 
and sectors, combined with a deep understanding 
of emerging markets and a practical outlook, to 
help private sector clients be competitive in the new 
climate economy. The Bank helps governments build 
expertise to work with their private sectors on climate-
oriented growth, as firms develop decarbonization 
plans and financial institutions work to increase their 
share of climate investments. 
For example, trust funds from Germany helped launch 
the World Bank’s Scaling Up Climate Finance through 
Greening the Financial Sector—or 30 by 30 Zero 
Program—in the Philippines. It is one of four countries 
targeted by the program, which aims to increase climate 
lending to 30 percent of participating banks’ portfolios 
by 2030. Work led by IFC is underway to tackle the 
regulatory and institutional constraints facing financial 
institutions, develop the market for climate thematic 
bonds, and build capacity and coordination for climate 
finance. By 2030, the program is also expected to assist 
the Philippines in aligning financial sector strategies 
and reforms with the implementation of new NDCs 
and raise at least $400 million of climate funding from 
IFC to local banks, and another $250 million through 
the introduction of climate thematic bonds issued by 
real sector companies to the capital markets.
As a bank known for its 
commitment to sustainable 
finance and climate change 
mitigation, we are delighted that 
IFC has entrusted us with this 
significant investment.

In conjunction with the 30 by 30 Zero Program, 
technical assistance and advisory service grants from 
the Climate Support Facility (CSF) have contributed 
to financial sector reforms in the Philippines. The 
World Bank provided guidance on developing a 
green taxonomy and incentives for green investments 
within the country’s central bank and its Securities 
Commission, as well as on incorporating climate and 
environmental risks into financial institutions’ risk 
management frameworks and the country’s Insurance 
Code reform. This support enabled the government to 
implement a series of sustainable development policy 
actions under three DPOs approved in 2022 and 2023, 
together totaling $1.75 billion.
Trust fund and FIF financing help the Bank employ a 
range of instruments to de-risk high-impact climate 
projects in low and middle-income countries. For 
example, bespoke guarantee offerings provided by 
MIGA ease private sector investments in renewable 
energy development, including generation capacity, 
mini-grid systems, transmission systems, and battery 
storage. The Renewable Energy Catalyst Trust 
Fund (RECTF) provides a variety of risk mitigation 
and capacity tools toward this end, such as a first-
loss facility, reinsurance, guarantee tenor extension, 
financial grants, and soon, liquidity support. MIGA 
has so far used the RECTF for two guarantee projects, 
together amounting to $9.3 million in issuance 
of guarantees.
In 2022, the World Bank issued the Wildlife 
Conservation Bond (WCB) in support of South 
Africa’s efforts to conserve endangered species. Also 
known as the “Rhino Bond,” this five-year $150 million 
sustainable development bond includes a potential 
performance payment from the GEF, which will 
contribute to protecting and increasing black rhino 
populations in protected areas of South Africa. The 
WCB channels private sector investments to achieve 
conservation outcomes, while bringing jobs to local 
communities. Drawing on this model, in 2023, the 
World Bank priced a five-year $50 million, principal-
protected emission reduction-linked bond that 
mobilized private capital to increase financing for low-
carbon solutions in developing countries.
IFC uses blended finance, in which concessional 
funds from partners are blended with IFC’s own 
financing, to de-risk climate investments. A disciplined 
approach to deploying concessional funds minimizes 
the level of subsidy to avoid distorting markets and 
allows the crowding-in of other commercial financiers. 
For example, IFC invested $100 million in Egypt's 
first-ever private sector green bond to unlock finance 
for climate-smart projects, reduce GHG emissions, 
and support the country's energy transition. The 
bond will help Egypt's Commercial International 
Bank (CIB) increase lending to businesses investing 
in eco-friendly initiatives that are still nascent in 
Egypt, including green buildings, renewable energy, 
and energy efficiency. The project will benefit from 
$1.4 million in funding from the blended finance 
component of the UK-IFC Market Accelerator for 
Green Construction (MAGC) trust fund through 
performance-based incentives to motivate developers 
to construct certified green buildings.
Blended finance has helped Vietnam launch the 
development of a first-of-its-kind modern waste-to-
energy plant in Bac Ninh province to increase municipal 
solid waste treatment capacity, which currently hovers 
around 50 percent. The project includes a $15 million 
concessional loan from the Finland-IFC Blended 
Finance for Climate Program. By introducing an 
environmentally sound waste treatment and disposal 
solution, the plant will help avoid health and safety 
issues related to soil and groundwater contamination. 
Technology plays a powerful role in stimulating 
climate-smart innovations and investments. The 
World Bank serves as the trustee for AgResults 
Initiative, a FIF that uses pay-for-results prize 
competitions to incentivize the private sector to 
help develop, deliver, and scale up technologies 
that enhance productivity for smallholder farmers. 
One such competition in Vietnam sought to identify 
novel approaches for reducing GHG emissions and 
increasing yields in rice cultivation throughout South 
and Southeast Asia.

IFC’s TechEmerge program matches innovators with 
companies to pilot projects, develop relationships, 
and scale solutions that tackle some of the world’s 
most pressing problems. Trust funds help expand 
the program’s reach. For example, funding from 
the Sustainable Cooling Innovation Programme 
Trust Fund enabled the TechEmerge Sustainable 
Cooling Cities LAC project to support 18 companies 
in Colombia and Mexico through two years of field 
testing new cooling technology. Demand for cooling 
in Mexico, including air conditioning, refrigeration, 
and other applications, is expected to increase six-fold 
in the next 30 years. As a result of this project, two 
innovators were able to raise $8.8 million in funding 
from external sources, and another 15 commercial 
contracts totaling $5 million are under discussion. 
In South Asia, the Program for Asia Resilience 
to Climate Change (PARCC) supported both 
the TechEmerge Resilience Fund and the Climate 
Innovation Challenge Fund. They brought together 
government representatives, the private sector, civil 
society, and other development partners from across 
the region to assess 26 crowdsourced solutions for 
providing local communities and decision makers with 
accurate information on climate and disaster risks and 
how to manage them. Innovations were diverse and 
included a two-way Wi-Fi community radio to connect 
signal-dark communities in India’s Dharma Valley, a 
parametric insurance product for flood-prone farming 
communities in Nepal, and a mobile app to monitor in 
real time the status of critical infrastructure in Nepal 
and Bangladesh.

When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, the 
World Bank mounted the fastest and largest financial 
response in its history to help countries respond to, and 
recover from, the crisis. Working together, the global 
community brought the pandemic under control, but 
not before it led to nearly 7 million reported deaths9 and 
total expected economic losses estimated at nearly 
$14 trillion through the end of 2023.10 The recovery 
has been highly uneven, leaving behind some of the 
poorest countries.
As of June 30, 2023, the World Bank committed $270 
billion of financial support to help public and private 
sector clients overcome the wide-ranging health and 
socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Bank’s response has helped to save lives, protect 
poor and vulnerable people, maintain education 
continuity, ensure sustainable business growth and 
job creation, and strengthen policies, institutions, and 
investments. The COVID-19 crisis has also spurred 
collective action to augment the existing global health 
security financing system and to mobilize additional 
resources to build health systems and strengthen 
capacity for pandemic prevention, preparedness, 
and response.
To that end, the Bank facilitated the creation of a 
new FIF, the Pandemic Fund, in September 2022. 
It provides a dedicated stream of additional, long-
term financing to strengthen pandemic prevention, 
preparedness, and response capabilities in low 
and middle-income countries through investments 
and technical support at the national, regional, 
and global levels. The fund raised $2 billion in seed 
capital from 25 donors and issued its first call for 
proposals in February 2023. The World Bank brought 
its convening power, knowledge, and experience to 
leading the development and operationalization of the 
Pandemic Fund at record speed, collaborating with 
G20 members and beyond, the WHO, and a variety 
of other stakeholders, including MDBs, global health 
institutions, and civil society. The Bank hosts the 
Pandemic Fund’s secretariat, and serves as trustee 
and one of the fund’s implementing entities.
This new Pandemic Fund and other trust funds and FIFs 
have played important roles in the Bank’s COVID-19 
pandemic response and larger efforts to strengthen 
health systems. Between fiscal 2019 to 2023, IBRD/
IDA trust funds disbursed $1.2 billion of RE grants 
toward pandemic prevention, preparedness, and 
response. These disbursements peaked in fiscal 2021 
during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 
3.1) and surpassed health-related RE disbursements 
that year. This is because the World Bank’s response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic extended beyond health-
related activities, and still does.  
A key contributor is the Health Emergency 
Preparedness and Response Umbrella Program 
(HEPR), established by the World Bank in June 
2020 to help countries respond to the pandemic 
and prepare for future health emergencies. During 
its first two years, HEPR mobilized $211 million in 
resources and allocated $126 million through June 
2023 to support 45 country and regional efforts 
in health emergency preparedness and response. 
These resources have co-financed IDA investments, 
provided funds to countries not eligible for IDA 
resources, supported regional efforts to strengthen 
cross-border health emergency preparedness, and 
created a global effort to build the evidence needed 
to identify the most impactful health emergency 
preparedness and response efforts.
To save lives, for example, HEPR helped the Solomon 
Islands extend its COVID-19 vaccine deployment 
efforts to hard-to-reach areas in its archipelago of 
six major islands and more than 900 smaller islands. 
The HEPR grant provided funds to purchase boats, 
vehicles, and safety equipment to reach remote 
communities, and to conduct a communication 
and advocacy campaign to combat misinformation 
about COVID-19 vaccines. To help prepare for future 
pandemics, HEPR funding has enabled countries 
in Eastern Africa to strengthen their internal health 
systems and create more effective cross-border 
surveillance and response networks. In just nine 
months in 2022, the completeness and timeliness

of priority disease reporting increased from 10 to 90 
percent in Malawi, 30 to 60 percent in Rwanda, and 68 
to 90 percent in Tanzania.
To protect the poor and most vulnerable, trust 
funds have financed social protection programs to 
ease some of the economic losses that households 
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. For 
example, three trust funds—the Trust Fund for 
Gaza and West Bank (WBGBK), the Palestinian 
Umbrella for Resilience Support to the Economy 
(PURSE), and the Middle East and North Africa 
Region Umbrella MDTF—financed the Emergency 
Social Protection COVID-19 Response Project, 
which provided cash transfers to more than 95,000 
vulnerable households in the West Bank and Gaza. 
This project also supported a cash-for-work program, 
which 
helped 
non-governmental 
organizations 
(NGOs) provide temporary jobs to 4,000 people, 85 
percent of whom were women.

(CARP). The project seeks to expand financial 
inclusion through non-bank financial institutions 
to revitalize Iraq’s economy post-pandemic and 
strengthen long-term resilience within its financial 
ecosystem. Comprehensive sector analysis, advice 
on regulatory reforms, and targeted assistance to 
microfinance institutions have made it easier for 
struggling businesses to access crucial financial 
resources. The project also empowers small 
businesses and entrepreneurs through grants 
and mentorship.

To help countries strengthen their policies, 
institutions, and investments to foster long-term 
recovery, the Korea-World Bank Partnership 
Facility (KWPF) funded analytical work to help 
countries in Latin America and the Caribbean 
region better respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The study compared the policy responses of 10 
countries in the region with South Korea and 
Uruguay, two high-performers in the first stages 
of the pandemic. A practical guide on developing 
and implementing proactive, population-based 
COVID-19 
testing 
was 
produced, 
as 
were 
two real-time analytical dashboards for safe 
economic reactivation in Colombia and Peru. 
The research also informed a regional report on 
using wastewater-based epidemiology to enhance 
pandemic  surveillance capabilities.
3.1 Improving Health Systems 
and Regional Cooperation 
Immediate COVID-19 response measures have largely 
given way to longer-term investments in pandemic 
prevention and preparedness. This comprises many 
elements, including strong and resilient health 
systems, particularly for primary care, to facilitate 
the detection of disease outbreaks, provide essential 
care, and support the deployment of vaccines and 
other medical countermeasures. The COVID-19 crisis 
laid bare long-standing weaknesses in pandemic 
preparedness in many countries, especially low and 
middle-income countries. World Bank trust funds bring 
technical knowledge, advice, and analysis to countries 
to help them strengthen their national systems and 
regional cooperation. 
The Bank’s work on pandemic preparedness 
involves One Health, a collaborative approach that 
brings animal, environmental, and public health 
sectors together to prevent, detect, respond to, and 
recover from infectious diseases. With support from 
Food Systems 2030, the World Bank is focused on 
embedding the One Health approach across the 
institution and in regions worldwide. This includes 
Central Asia, where advisory and analytical work 
underpinned the One Health Framework for Action, 
which aims to contribute to pandemic preparedness, 
with priority given to zoonoses, antimicrobial 
resistance, and food safety. The framework also

provides an investment roadmap for the region 
still struggling with the economic impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2022, five Central 
Asian countries signed a joint communiqué agreeing 
to adopt the framework, including establishing 
governance structures and engaging in joint resource 
mobilization, data sharing, and preparatory work to 
implement national and regional activities.
The One Health Framework for 
Action provides an excellent 
opportunity for accelerating the 
operationalization of the One 
Health approach in Central Asia 
and strengthening regional and 
cross-sectoral collaboration.
— Peter Sousa Hoejskov, Technical Officer on Food Safety 
and Zoonotic Diseases, WHO
Overall, countries with universal and progressive 
health coverage were better equipped to mitigate the 
negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Côte d’Ivoire, for example, was able to draw on an 
ongoing IDA project and technical assistance from 
the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children 
and Adolescents (GFF) that had rolled out a 
universal health coverage program to make services 
more affordable to communities. Between 2019 and 
2021, over 3.5 million individuals were enrolled in 
the health insurance program, representing an 89 
percent increase in three years. Beginning in 2020, 
the government targeted individuals working in the 
informal sector, many of them women, by encouraging 
them to register for an insurance card. This also 
helped mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic. By the end of 2021, 20 percent of all insured 
individuals were informal sector workers.
Egypt had just embarked on a path toward universal 
health coverage before the COVID-19 outbreak. 
Experiences during the pandemic underscored 
the benefits that would flow if Egypt could broaden 
access to safe and quality health care. IFC used the 
MENA Private Sector Development Trust Fund to 
launch the Egypt Health Quality Advisory Program 
to support private health care service providers 
across the country in enhancing patient safety 
practices and upgrading their quality assurance 
systems. The project has assessed and advised 100 
health care facilities across 15 governorates, which 
have used recommendations to improve processes 
and training to meet national and international 
accreditation standards.
IFC trust funds11 have also assisted local governments 
in assessing their response to COVID-19 to identify 
challenges and successes, lessons learned, and 
ways to future-proof their response capacity. In the 
Philippines, for example, Quezon City was one of 
the worst-affected cities due to its high population 
density, poor urban communities, inadequate health 
infrastructure, and limited government capacity. 
The IFC health advisory team 
visit was useful. They helped 
us identify, measure, and 
assess areas for performance 
improvement and helped build 
staff capabilities through their 
comprehensive training program 
for quality managers.

The Quezon City COVID-19 Advisory Support 
Project identified the need to invest in better data 
management and reconfigure the city’s COVID-19 
testing and vaccination response to address broader 
public health needs. The Quezon City government 
validated the assessment results and is taking on 
recommendations. 
World Bank research funded by the Canada-
Caribbean Resilience Facility (CCRF) has garnered 
lessons learned on pandemic preparedness and 
responsiveness in the Caribbean, particularly on 
COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake. Eight 
out of 20 countries in the region were still below 
a 50 percent vaccination rate as of March 2023. 
Phone and social media surveys conducted across 
multiple countries revealed distrust and concerns 
around the risks of vaccines with few perceived 
benefits. The research has led to several knowledge 
products documenting the challenges of COVID-19 
vaccine deployment in Caribbean countries and 
recommendations for improving community outreach 
and vaccine promotion strategies.
3.2 Promoting Local Markets 
and Manufacturing 
Through its private sector arm, IFC, the World 
Bank invests in initiatives to build up local vaccine, 
pharmaceutical, and health-related manufacturing 
capabilities in emerging markets to strengthen 
domestic capacity to prepare for and respond to future 
pandemics. IFC projects aim to improve the quality 
and accessibility of health products and help clients 
seize economic opportunities in medical equipment 
and pharmaceutical production. 
In particular, the IFC-led Global Health Platform 
(GHP) has helped countries respond quickly to 
COVID-19 disruptions in the short-term and continues 
to drive long-term change in the health sector. The 
platform generated close to $2 billion in investment 
commitments, including $600 million mobilized from 
a diverse set of financiers, to develop local health 
supply chains. With funding from donors,12 the GHP 
has delivered advisory services to address gender 
disparities in the health care professions, improve

care providers with better quality assurance practices 
are more attractive investment targets for financiers. 
The EPiHC project seeks to build transparent, resilient 
health systems through a set of shared principles for 
ethical decision making and behavior.
3.3 Facilitating FIF 
Contributions
The response of the international development 
community to the COVID-19 pandemic has benefitted 
greatly from the large-scale contributions of health-
related FIFs to save lives and protect the most 
vulnerable. FIFs have contributed not only to the 
immediate crisis response by delivering vaccines and 
other health supplies to millions of people around 
the world, but also to strengthening health systems 
and enhancing preparedness for future pandemics. 
In addition to creating the new Pandemic Fund in 
September 2022 and facilitating its development 
and launch in record speed, the World Bank provides 
indispensable 
administrative, 
operational, 
legal, 
and financial services to the following FIFs, which 
are making important contributions to COVID-19 
health responses.
The 
Coalition 
for 
Epidemic 
Preparedness 
Innovations (CEPI) brings together public and 
private sector entities, philanthropies, and civil 
society organizations to develop vaccines to stop 
future epidemics. The World Bank serves as a limited 
financial trustee. CEPI supports the world’s largest 
portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines and is the only public 
sector funder of research and development that has 
systematically leveraged its investments to enable 
equitable access to vaccines, guaranteeing access 
to doses for the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access 
(COVAX) initiative. Working through the World Bank 
and other partners, COVAX distributed almost 2 billion 
doses of COVID-19 vaccines to 146 countries by 
November 2022. CEPI continues to invest in the next 
generation of vaccines against COVID-19 variants and 
other coronaviruses.
access to quality health care, accelerate digital 
transformation in health care and pharmaceutical 
companies, expand and diversify medical equipment 
manufacturing, and develop financing options for 
medical equipment acquisitions.
For example, GHP trust funds enabled technical 
advice to seven private sector clients in Africa, Asia, 
and the Middle East on manufacturing masks, gowns, 
and other personal protection equipment (PPE). IFC 
advised manufacturers on PPE production standards, 
connected them to potential buyers and global PPE 
procurement efforts, and shared market analysis. 
The program also served as a global platform to 
share knowledge on PPE, including global and 
regional market trends, international standards and 
certifications, PPE waste and circularity, PPE fit for 
women health care workers, and workers’ health and 
safety during PPE production.
The trust-funded Africa Medical Equipment Facility 
(AMEF) supports the acquisition of medical equipment 
by smaller health care enterprises, including hospitals, 
clinics, pathology laboratories, diagnostic imaging 
centers, and medical equipment distributors in 
Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, 
Tanzania, and Uganda. AMEF’s client banks have 
approved the first six medical equipment loans. In 
partnership with the Government of Norway and 
under the umbrella of the GHP, IFC also launched the 
Women’s Leadership in Private Healthcare working 
group, which brings together senior women leaders 
from 17 health care organizations in Africa, East Asia, 
and the Middle East and North Africa to identify and 
address barriers to women’s leadership in the field.
IFC’s efforts to raise standards in private health care 
include work on the Healthcare Quality Assessment 
Tool and the Ethical Principles in Health Services 
(EPiHC), both supported by donors through the 
GHP. The Healthcare Quality Assessment Tool aims 
to increase access to safe and quality health care by 
improving quality assurance processes and practices 
of health care providers. This also contributes to 
increased investment in health care facilities as health

The International Finance Facility for Immunization 
(IFFIm) issues vaccine bonds in capital markets 
(backed by binding pledges from donor countries) 
that provide immediate funding for Gavi, the Vaccine 
Alliance, to purchase and distribute vaccines. With 
the World Bank serving as treasury manager to 
enable these transactions, IFFIm has played a critical 
role in frontloading donor pledges to help fund the 
purchase of COVID-19 vaccines. Since the start of 
the pandemic, IFFIm has disbursed $980 million to 
Gavi for the COVAX, as well as $272 million to Gavi for 
vaccine development. 
The World Bank is also the trustee of the Global 
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. 
Over the span of 20 years, the Global Fund has 
invested more than $55.4 billion across 100 countries 
to save 50 million lives and reduce the combined 
death rate from these three diseases by more than 
half in the countries where it invests. The Global 
Fund’s COVID-19 response amounted to $5 billion 
that supported 109 countries and 22 multi-country 
programs, by procuring medical supplies and 
protecting front-line health workers with training 
and PPE.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused the worst disruption 
to education in decades, leading to prolonged 
school closures and exacerbating the learning 
crisis and human capital development challenges. 
The Global Partnership for Education (GPE), 
for which the World Bank is the trustee, host, and 
largest implementing entity, provided approximately 
$500 million in accelerated funding and COVID-19 
grants to help partner country governments plan and 
implement emergency responses. Funding focused 
on preventing the negative impacts of COVID-19 
on education, ensuring continued learning for 
children, preventing the spread of COVID-19 in and 
through schools, and supporting vulnerable groups, 
especially girls.

**Image Description:**
The image shows a scene of a vaccination process. The layout centers around two main subjects: a healthcare worker administering a vaccine injection to a seated woman.

Key elements:
- The woman on the left is wearing a black shirt, a face mask, and a clear plastic face shield. She is seated and has her sleeve rolled up as she receives the vaccine.
- The healthcare worker on the right is dressed in blue protective clothing, including a surgical cap, face mask, glasses, and a face shield. The worker is holding a syringe injecting the woman.
- In the background, other seated individuals are also being attended to in a similar manner.
- There is a sign behind them with text in capital letters. The visible text reads: "VACCIN... (PAGPAPABAKUNA)." The partial word "VACCIN..." likely stands for "Vaccination," and "PAGPAPABAKUNA" is a Filipino term relating to vaccination.

The environment appears clinical and organized, with a blue cooler box and sanitizing products visible behind the subjects, reinforcing the vaccination center setting. The image conveys a message of public health efforts and vaccination development as part of an annual development report.

4. Responding to Fragility, Conflict, and Violence  |  31
By 2030, nearly 59 percent of the world’s extreme poor 
will live in countries affected by fragility, conflict, and 
violence (FCV). This sobering projection reveals the 
challenges extend well beyond Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine, fighting in Sudan, and other headline news. 
Rising inequality, lack of opportunity, discrimination, 
and exclusion fuel the spike in violent conflict seen 
across the world since 2010. Governments often lack 
the capacity or will to manage risks, thus making 
institutions and people more vulnerable to economic 
shocks, natural disasters, and global challenges and 
regional spillovers, such as the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the influx of refugees from war-torn areas. As 
conflicts continue across the globe, the number of 
people displaced by them has reached record levels. 
Of the more than 108 million forcibly  displaced persons 
worldwide, an estimated 76 percent are hosted in low 
and middle-income countries, often by communities 
facing their own socio-economic challenges.13
Responding to fragility, conflict, and violence is key 
to attaining the SDGs and a priority of the World 
Bank, as articulated in its 2020–2025 FCV Strategy. 
A record $30 billion in financing for FCV-affected 
countries was approved in December 2021 under 
IDA’s 20th replenishment to meet diverse challenges 
in the poorest countries. The World Bank’s response to 
hotspots like Afghanistan and Ukraine has been rapid 
and effective, with trust funds playing key roles. 
Following Afghanistan’s abrupt change in government 
in August 2021, the Afghanistan Resilience 
Trust Fund (ARTF), formerly the Afghanistan 
Reconstruction Trust Fund, has enabled the World 
Bank to provide over $1 billion in off-budget support 
to deliver essential food, livelihood, health, water, 
and education services to the Afghan people and 
to build the capacity of local NGOs and civil society 
organizations. The World Bank’s new funding 
modality channels funding through United Nations 
agencies and the Aga Khan Foundation to implement 
all operations. These activities aim to address 
basic services and pave the way for development 
in Afghanistan's complex environment. ARTF also 
supports on-the-ground surveys, data collection, and 
analytics that give the Afghan people a voice and help 
shape the international community’s humanitarian-
development response in this FCV context. 
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, 
the World Bank and other development partners 
have mobilized more than $37.5 billion for Ukraine 
through June 30, 2023, of which over $19.5 billion 
has been disbursed through IBRD/IDA trust funds. 
While trust funds consistently devote a large share of 
their resources to projects in countries on the World 
Bank’s official list of fragile and conflict-affected 
situations, RE disbursements for FCV-affected states 
climbed to 94 percent of total RE disbursements in 
fiscal 2023, largely due to support for Ukraine (Figure 
4.1). RE disbursements for FCV-affected states from 
fiscal 2019–23 totaled $25.3 billion and 77 percent of 
this went to Ukraine through standalone trust funds 
for the country’s economic recovery (Figure 4.2).
This huge increase from previous years’ disbursements 
reflects the shared commitment of the World Bank 
and development partners to support Ukraine through 
urgent repair projects and coordination with the 
government for recovery and reconstruction. These 
figures also show that trust funds have been a vehicle 
of choice to deliver fast-disbursing, targeted funding 
where it is needed most. Immediately after Russia’s 
invasion began, the World Bank established two 
multi-donor trust funds in fiscal 2022 to provide $2.5 
billion in grant co-financing to two Bank operations: 
the Financing of Recovery of Economic Emergency 
(FREE) Ukraine Supplemental DPO, approved in March 
2022, and the Public Expenditures for Administrative 
Capacity Endurance (PEACE) in Ukraine Project, 
approved in June 2022.

The FREE operation provided an immediate platform 
for the Bank to work with Ukraine’s development 
partners and mobilize additional resources on top of 
$484 million in IBRD financing, including $134 million 
backed by guarantees. Bilateral donors (Austria, 
Denmark, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States) contributed 
grant financing for an additional $1.2 billion through 
the FREE Multi-donor Trust Fund within two 
weeks of Russia’s invasion.14 Together, $2.25 billion in 
emergency budget financing was mobilized to 
help meet the immediate social and fiscal needs 
precipitated by the invasion. 
The PEACE project has raised $19.7 billion in World 
Bank and trust fund resources to sustain support for an 
estimated 13 million Ukrainians. The bulk, $17.9 billion, 
has already been disbursed, benefitting 10 million 
pensioners, 500,000 education employees, 145,000 
government employees, 56,000 first responders, and 
over 3 million social assistance beneficiaries and 
internally displaced people. 
In December 2022, the World Bank launched the 
Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction and 
Reform Trust Fund (URTF) for Ukraine’s immediate 
repairs and recovery efforts. The trust fund has received 
contributions and pledges from Austria, Canada, 
Iceland, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, 
Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland totaling $1.1 billion. 
The URTF is a coordinated financing and support 
mechanism to assist the Government of Ukraine in 
sustaining its administrative and service delivery 
capacity, conducting relief efforts, and planning 
and implementing its recovery, reconstruction, and 
reform agenda. 
The World Bank has since established the Multi-Donor 
Resources for Institutions and Infrastructure 
(MRII) Facility to coordinate IBRD, IFC, and MIGA 
efforts for Ukraine. The PEACE project and the 
URTF now fall under the MRII Facility, as does IFC’s 
Economic Resilience Action (ERA) program and other 
initiatives that allow donors to help Ukraine address 
its immediate needs to sustain key public services, the 
private sector, and wider recovery and reconstruction. 
The MRII takes a phased and multi-pronged approach 
to mobilizing financing and coordinating resources 
through guarantees, co- and parallel financing, and 
other financial instruments. 
4.1 Addressing the Drivers 
of FCV
The Bank supports countries at every stage of fragility, 
working to prevent violent conflict and interpersonal 
tensions before they turn into full-blown crises, but 
also remaining engaged during conflict and crisis 
to preserve hard-won development gains, protect 
essential institutions, and build resilience so countries 
are set on the course for recovery. Trust funds help 
enable this work with resources to tackle the root 
causes of FCV in various contexts and promote peace 
and stability.
In particular, the State and Peacebuilding Fund 
(SPF) is the World Bank’s leading global trust fund for 
implementing the Bank’s FCV Strategy. SPF provides 
catalytic financing to help address drivers of fragility, 
prevent conflict, activate rapid crisis response, and 
build long-term resilience. SPF’s mandate is to innovate 
and push the frontiers of the Bank’s engagement in 
FCV situations through activities that can be scaled 
and mainstreamed. SPF provides seed funding for 
pilots, tools, and analytical work that inform larger 
World Bank projects. 
For example, SPF funded a Survivor-centered 
Accessibility Framework Evaluation (SAFE) along 
migratory routes in Central America. The research 
has helped to fill knowledge gaps about the violence 
women and girls experience in their home countries 
and during their journeys along common migratory 
routes, thereby influencing World Bank operations 
on safe migration and survivor services for migrant 
women in Central America.
14 Japan made a parallel loan in the amount of $600 million.

In Iraq, funding from the Japan Social Development 
Fund (JSDF) mobilizes youth as agents of change for 
building more peaceful societies. The project fosters 
the socio-economic inclusion of conflict-affected 
youth ages 15–29 through entrepreneurship and 
youth-led community development activities. Over 
3,330 young people, half of whom are women, have 
received psychosocial support and soft skills training, 
and several trainees have gone on to receive micro-
entrepreneurship startup capital and coaching. 
Somalia has also benefited from trust fund financing 
to promote peace and improve citizen confidence by 
rebuilding state functionality. The Somalia Country 
Engagement Program co-finances a $130 million 
IDA project that supports the Federal Government 
of Somalia and eligible Federal Member States in 
strengthening resource management systems, an 
inter-governmental fiscal framework, and service 
delivery systems in health and education after years 
of off-system, off-budget donor financing for these 
services. It has also fostered key policy reforms for 
state-building and enabled budget transparency and 
citizen engagement activities. 
The 
Global Water Security and Sanitation 
Partnership (GWSP) has helped Somalia improve 
rural water supply. Decades of low investment had 
left water points in pasture lands scarce, claimed by 
clans, and intrinsically linked to resource conflict. Over 
the past five years, the GWSP has helped transform 
how the World Bank works in Somalia by developing 
capacity and political capital, resulting in over 360,000 
people benefiting from improved water sources and 
a portfolio of World Bank grants to the water sector 
totaling $102 million.
The project is helping us foster 
policy reforms and nurture the 
basics of federalism.

(2017–2022), Somalia
To help Zimbabwe address accountability and 
transparency 
challenges 
and 
increase 
citizen 
confidence in the use of public resources, the 
Bank launched the Public Finance Management 
Enhancement Project with financing from the 
Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund (ZIMREF). From 
2016–2021, the project contributed to enhancing 
fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, 
and service delivery efficiency, through strengthened 
systems, procedures, citizen engagement, and 
targeted capacity building. The project, together with 
other analytical work, established the foundation for 
future reforms to promote economic stability and 
inclusive growth in Zimbabwe. In 2023, the ZIMREF 
was restructured and rebranded as the Zimbabwe 
Socio-Economic Transformation Fund (ZISET), 
a country-specific umbrella program that will 
support the implementation of Zimbabwe’s National 
Development Strategy 2021–25.
FIFs also make important contributions to addressing 
the drivers and impacts of FCV and strengthening 
resilience, 
especially 
for 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
and marginalized populations. For example, the 
World Bank hosts the secretariat and serves as an 
implementing entity for the Global Agriculture 
and Food Security Program (GAFSP). It works to 
build resilient and sustainable agriculture and food 
systems in low-income countries, in times of crisis 
and beyond. With co-financing from GAFSP, the West 
Africa Food System Resilience Program will support
the second phase of Burkina Faso’s National Rural 
Sector Program targeting 125 communes in nine 
regions chosen for their high agricultural potential
and favorable climate conditions. It is part of the 
broader regional effort to increase agricultural 
productivity 
through 
climate-smart 
agriculture, 
promote intraregional value chains and trade, and 
build capacity to manage agricultural and food 
insecurity risks.

4.2 Easing the Impact of 
Forced Displacement 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused the fastest-
growing refugee crisis in Europe since the end of 
World War II. Globally, an estimated 108 million people 
have been forcibly displaced from their homes, either 
internally in their countries or externally as refugees.15 
Some of these displaced people face the prospect of 
never being able to return home. Given the protracted 
nature of forced displacement, the global community 
has combined humanitarian assistance with longer-
term development financing to help refugees become 
more self-reliant so that they can contribute more to 
their own futures and their host communities.
During the last five years, IBRD/IDA trust funds have 
disbursed $844 million to help countries address 
issues related to forced displacement (Figure 4.3). 
More than 90 percent of these resources went to five

countries, with Afghanistan absorbing nearly half, 
followed by Türkiye, Jordan, Lebanon, and Ethiopia. 
In fiscal 2023, Global Concessional Financing 
Facility (GCFF) disbursed $9 million to Lebanon to 
address the protracted economic and social crises 
in the country and the Port of Beirut explosion 
in 2020, in addition to the influx of refugees from 
neighboring Syria.
RE disbursements for activities that address forced 
displacement peaked at 11 percent of total RE 
disbursements in fiscal 2020 largely due to support 
for Türkiye, which hosts the largest number of 
refugees in the world (Figure 4.3). The European 
Commission–World Bank Partnership Program on 
Europe and Central Asia (EEPP) provided a €45.5 
million grant to implement the Türkiye Employment 
Support for Syrians under the Temporary Protection 
and 
Turkish 
Citizens 
project.

The image shows a vast refugee camp with numerous white tents and prefabricated shelters densely packed over a wide area. The tents have the "UNHCR" logo branded on them, indicating the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' involvement in the camp setup. There are utility poles and water tanks visible among the tents, highlighting some infrastructure present in the camp.

In the foreground, a man is interacting with three children, two of whom are standing close to the man while another smaller child stands slightly behind them. The expressions and body language suggest a moment of connection and care within the challenging environment.

The background reveals a dry, barren landscape with a distant settlement far beyond the refugee camp. The sky is overcast, adding a muted tone to the scene.

There is no additional visible text other than the "UNHCR" logo on the tents. The overall layout emphasizes the scale of the camp and the human aspect within it, making it fitting for an annual development report focused on humanitarian efforts or refugee assistance programs.

formal markets and promote employment in host 
communities even during times of crisis. Nearly 38,000 
people in four Turkish provinces—more than half of 
whom were Syrian refugees—benefited from a range 
of employment programs and services, and over 
18,000 Syrian refugees and Turkish citizens were able 
to obtain formal jobs. Overall, more than 70,000 
refugees and nearly 5.8 million Turkish citizens 
registered and benefited from job counseling services.

To increase the socio-economic integration of forcibly 
displaced people in the Middle East and East Africa, 
the World Bank worked with the Netherlands, the 
International Labour Organization (ILO), UNICEF, and 
UNHCR to establish the PROSPECTS Partnership 
on Jobs and Education for Forcibly Displaced Persons 
and Host Communities. In 2022, PROSPECTS helped 
IFC launch the StartMashreq program in Iraq, Jordan, 
and Lebanon with startup accelerator Flat6Labs.16 
The program aims to develop a virtual education and 
incubation platform to support startups and address 
the policy and regulatory barriers to their growth and 
scale-up. Promoting entrepreneurship in the region 
is expected to have a domino effect on creating 
opportunities for young, displaced, or otherwise 
marginalized groups.
Jordanian hosts and Syrian refugees seeking jobs 
also benefit from FIF financing from the Global 
Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF). It co-
finances a $400 million joint IBRD and IDA project that 
has contributed to aligning donors and development

partners’ activities toward formalizing the Syrian labor 
force and easing Syrians’ access to jobs. Under the 
Economic Opportunities for Jordanians and Syrian 
Refugees project, the number of work permits 
issued to Syrians increased from 45,000 in 2019 to 
62,000 in 2022 and currently stands at 77,000. Jordan 
was also the site for the Mashreq Gender Facility’s 
pilot program on increasing access to economic 
opportunities for displaced women. Supported by the 
Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality (UFGE), the 
pilot helped local municipalities understand and take 
regulatory action to address the gender barriers that 
displaced women face in the job market.
Another important focus area is education. Among 
the Syrian population in Lebanon, for example, 59 
percent of Syrian refugees ages 3–18 are not in 
formal schooling. The Lebanon Syrian Crisis Trust 
Fund (LSCTF) and the Results in Education for All 
Children Trust Fund (REACH) together provided 
$96 million in co-financing for a $100 million IDA 
project in Lebanon that has been instrumental 
in maintaining learning continuity despite the 
COVID-19 pandemic and other crises impacting 
the country, including teacher strikes. Performance-
based incentives and productivity allowances for 
public school teachers have helped these educators 
manage economic hardships and return to school to 
keep students learning.
In Colombia, a GCFF grant co-financed a $150 
million IBRD project, Improving Quality Healthcare 
Services and Efficiency, that helped increase access 
to health care for Venezuelan migrants. This first-
ever Program for Results (PforR) operation in 
Colombia provided grant financing to incentivize the 
government to incorporate a migrant and refugee 
The program is a recognition by 
the international community that

good by hosting Syrian refugees

perspective in the project, resulting in the affiliation of 
225,000 Venezuelan migrants into the social security 
system. This enabled them to access care during 
the pandemic, including vaccinations. A second-
generation health PforR is under consideration to 
increase migrants’ access to primary and mental 
health care, as well as specialized care for mothers, 
children, and HIV patients.
Moldova also hosts refugees displaced from Ukraine. 
To help Moldova mitigate the economic and social 
spillovers of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as 
build resilience and reduce vulnerabilities to future 
shocks, the World Bank partnered with key donors to 
establish the MDTF for Co-financing of the Moldova 
Development Policy Program. This $145 million trust 
fund seeks to bolster Moldova’s ability to implement 
its policy reform program. It complements IBRD and 
IDA commitments of $250 million for two Emergency 
Response, Resilience and Competitiveness DPOs 
and $34.2 million in grant commitments from 
the GCFF. A new umbrella program, Moldova – 
Growth, Resilience and Opportunities for Well-
being (M-GROW), is now under development and 
welcoming donor support for Moldova’s development 
toward European integration.
4.3 Forging Paths for 
Private Investment 
Even in high-risk environments, there are ways the 
private sector can help boost economic growth, 
livelihoods, and stability in fragile states. Trust funds 
support this work, demonstrating that like-minded 
donors and investors are willing to weather setbacks 
before clear progress is made.
For example, the IFC’s Africa Fragility Initiative (AFI) 
is a five-year $74 million program launched in 2021 to 
advance responsible private sector-led growth and 
job creation across 32 FCV-affected African countries 
where business costs are high, operational challenges 
formidable, and development needs great. AFI brings 
together the private sector and development partners 
to generate business development, identify local 
market champions, and improve the delivery of goods 
and services for potentially millions of people across 
the African continent.

Trust fund financing from AFI and the Global 
Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) 
Private Sector Window have helped Ethiopia advance 
its goal of establishing cooperative farming networks 
to foster economies of scale, higher quality products, 
and less fragmented supply chains. IFC advised 
Soufflet Malt Ethiopia, one of the leading investors in 
the malting sector, on expanding local sourcing. The 
project increased farmers’ access to improved seed 
varieties and established contract farming through 
aggregators and farmer financing models. By June 
2023, Soufflet’s annual purchase of grain from the 
local market was over 88,000 tons—more than double 
the project’s target—and the combined sales revenue 
of nearly 80,000 farmers increased to $87.5 million. 
Soufflet’s investment saves an estimated $50 million 
in imports per year for the country. 
In Nigeria, the IFC-managed multi-partner Facility 
for Investment Climate Advisory Services (FIAS)17 
funds the Upstream Special Economic Zone West 
Africa project, which advises the country on adopting 
and implementing legal, regulatory, and institutional 
frameworks for a competitive special economic zone. 
This will enable downstream private investments in 
health care, aeronautics, manufacturing, agribusiness, 
petrochemicals, and infrastructure while promoting 
greater economic opportunity for women.
17 FIAS activities are supported by the governments of Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.
18 Under the CAFEF arrangements, when MIGA makes a call on the callable guarantee by providing notice of the amount 
and claim payment date to the donor once MIGA has made a claim determination, the donor is required to pay the required 
contribution to MIGA no later than 10 days prior to the claim payment date.
Thanks to the malt barley 
business, we can provide better-
quality food and clothing to 
our family. I am happy that I am 
sending [my children] to school to 
fulfill all their needs.
— Tadelech Hunde, Farmer, Ethiopia  
Improving gender equality in Nigeria’s private sector 
is the focus of IFC’s Nigeria2Equal program. With 
support from the Comprehensive Japan Trust Fund, 
the program has expanded local research and data 
with reports on the cost of bullying and harassment in 
Nigeria’s workplaces as well as gender gap analyses 
of the most capitalized companies on the Nigeria 
Exchange. The program has created a peer learning 
platform where 18 companies have made more than 
165 public commitments to implement solutions to 
reduce gender gaps in their businesses.
The World Bank also engages with the private sector in 
conflict-affected and fragile economies through MIGA, 
which provides coverage where other insurers are 
often not willing or unable to go. Three of MIGA’s five 
trust funds are focused on FCV settings, including the 
West Bank and Gaza Trust Fund. It was established 
in 1997 to encourage private sector investment and 
economic development in the West Bank and Gaza, 
by offering political risk insurance to both local and 
foreign investors. The West Bank and Gaza is not a 
member of the IMF, World Bank, or MIGA, so it is not 
eligible for their sources of financing. The trust fund 
is used to cover guarantees underwritten in the West 
Bank and Gaza for the full amount of the guarantee. 
The trust fund had an initial paid-up contribution of just 
over $15 million. As of April 30, 2023, its underwriting 
capacity was around $28 million, with the increase 
resulting from interest income, premiums, and returns 
on investments since its inception. It has supported 
the issuance of MIGA guarantees worth $45 million 
(gross) for 13 projects.
The Conflict-Affected and Fragile Economies 
Facility (CAFEF) was established in 2013 to support 
MIGA guarantees in the riskiest of FCV contexts. 
CAFEF provides an initial loss layer, which comprises 
a first and second loss layer of donor grants and 
a callable guarantee from donors.18 MIGA also 


## Page 48
4. Responding to Fragility, Conflict, and Violence  |  39
participates in the first loss layer alongside CAFEF 
to the extent determined by the agency. The initial 
loss layer provides protection from the initial losses 
occurring under MIGA’s Contract of Guarantee. Excess 
loss above the initial loss layer is borne completely 
by MIGA, and where applicable, its reinsurance 
partners. CAFEF’s success lies in the fact that it offers 
a high degree of leverage to its donors. As of April 30, 
2023, CAFEF had facilitated more than $1 billion in 
gross MIGA guarantee issuance, and its corpus was 
$68.7 million. 
In Ukraine, CAFEF supported MIGA in issuing a €100 
million capital optimization guarantee ($107 million) for 
one year and one day to Raiffeisen Bank International 
AG (RBI), a major banking and financial services 
group based in Austria. The guarantee covers equity 
investments in RBI’s subsidiary, Raiffeisen Bank Joint 
Stock Company (RBUA) in Ukraine, against the risk of 
expropriation of funds with respect to the mandatory 
cash reserves held at Ukraine’s central bank (NBU). 
Local banking regulations mandate that RBUA 
maintain reserves with NBU to be able to conduct 
operations in Ukraine. MIGA’s capital optimization 
guarantee reduces the risk weight applicable to those 
mandatory reserves at the RBI group level to zero, 
freeing up funds that RBUA can use to expand local 
lending to individuals, small businesses, and corporate 
clients in critical industries and increase the volume 
of essential non-credit banking operations. Additional 
RBUA lending enabled by the MIGA guarantee will 
bolster employment and stimulate economic activity.  
Given the heightened risks of operating in Ukraine, MIGA 
created the Support for Ukraine’s Reconstruction 
and Economy Trust Fund (SURE TF). Established 
in March 2023 with Japan’s anchor contribution of 
$23 million (expected to grow to $300 million through 
contributions from additional donors), SURE TF will 
be used as a first-loss layer or toward reinsurance 
for MIGA’s guarantees in the country. MIGA blends 
donor financing from the SURE TF with risk exposure 
on its own books and crowds in public and private 
reinsurance where available to issue guarantees in 
support of Ukraine.

The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine have collided to upend the fiscal and trade 
balances of many developing countries, undermining 
their financial stability and long-term growth 
prospects. The Financial Stability Board affirms that 
the current economic environment of high inflation, 
lower growth, and much tighter global financial 
conditions is particularly challenging for financial 
stability. The limited policy space in many jurisdictions 
makes it more difficult for authorities to intervene 
should a shock materialize.19
The forces that have powered growth and prosperity 
since the early 1990s have weakened, resulting in a 
persistent and broad-based decline in long-term 
growth prospects.20 Productivity, trade, labor force, 
and investment growth are expected to flag over the 
remainder of this decade. The World Bank’s latest 
projections indicate that the world economy will remain 
frail—and at risk of a deeper downturn—into 2024.21 
This unstable economic footing imperils the ability 
of emerging markets and developing economies to 
create jobs and deliver essential services, and it puts 
development goals further out of reach. 
The World Bank has long regarded strengthening the 
international financial architecture and enhancing 
developing countries' participation in the global 
trading system as global public priorities requiring 
global collective action.22 Today, the Bank’s support for 
financial sustainability and resilience has broadened 
beyond strengthening countries financial systems 
and macro-economic stability to include financial 
inclusion, access to finance, building effective 
and accountable institutions to tackle corruption, 
strengthening tax revenue generation and debt 
management, and improving financial resilience in 
response to natural disasters. 
Trust funds and FIFs support this effort, especially 
through advisory services, analytics, and other 
knowledge-based activities that build institutional 
and human resource capacity to effectively manage 
instability. They contribute to projects that increase 
access to finance, promote free and fair trade, and 
help developing countries join and compete in the 
digital economy.
5.1 Increasing Access 
to Finance 
Across developing countries, 131 million micro, 
small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) have 
unmet financing needs estimated at approximately 
$5 trillion.23 In the financial services sector, women are 
disproportionately disadvantaged. While 76 percent of 
adults worldwide have a bank account, close to one-
third of adults—1.4 billion—still do not have one, and 
54 percent of all unbanked adults are women.24 The 
COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted MSMEs as 
well as financial service providers serving the base of 
the pyramid, including microfinance institutions, non-
bank financial institutions, and MSME-focused banks. 
With the support of trust funds, the World Bank seeks 
to expand access to financial products and services 
to those who have historically been excluded from the 
banking system, particularly in IDA countries, including 
micro-borrowers, SMEs, women, home buyers, and 
farmers, among others.

strengthening the international financial architecture, (d) enhancing developing countries’ participation in the global trading 
system, and (e) creating and sharing knowledge relevant for development. A World Bank report for the Development 
Committee, dated September 28, 2007, subsequently reaffirmed these five priority areas.

For example, in Georgia, the EU2020 Knowledge 
and Advisory Services facilitated the design and 
implementation of a $103 million IBRD project that has 
strengthened the enabling environment for MSMEs to 
access finance post-pandemic. Policy dialogue and 
analytical reports prepared with trust fund financing 
paved the way for several important reforms, including 
the adoption of the new Law on Investment Funds 
and amendments to the Law on the Securities Market 
and the Law on Payment Systems and Payment 
Services. The work also helped launch reforms on 
fintechs, financial infrastructure, and insurance, and 
strengthened a partial credit guarantee program, 
which aims to address high collateral requirements 
and risk aversion of financial institutions to unlock 
financial intermediation to SMEs.
To facilitate access to finance for agri-MSMEs and 
small farmers in Central Europe, Austrian funding 
through FIAS supported IFC’s Central Europe 
Agriculture Finance Digital Platform in developing a 
digital gateway to address information asymmetry 
between lenders and small farmers. It consolidates 
finance, climate, pricing, and other information based 
on digital data. It also provides non-financial services 
and training on climate-smart solutions for farmers 
and agri-MSMEs.
Ukrainian refugees also have financial needs, but 
without proof of Ukrainian bank records or credit 
histories, they struggle to open bank accounts or obtain 
credit in host countries. Drawing on the partnerships 
and experiences of the Ukraine Financial Inclusion 
Credit Reporting project funded by donors,25 IFC 
launched the Digital Data Corridors initiative in 2022. 
The initiative uses existing Ukrainian and European 
credit information infrastructure and brings together 
credit information providers, financial institutions, and 
industry experts to allow financial institutions to receive 
international credit histories, identity verification, and 
bank transaction data electronically in real time. By 
the end of 2022, credit bureaus in the largest host 
countries for Ukrainians, including Poland, Czechia, 
and Moldova, were linked to the corridor, facilitating 
access to finance for Ukrainian refugees. 
This pioneering initiative will 
allow Ukrainian citizens to show 
the positive credit history they 
earned back home and build trust 
with a future employer and access 
finance from Moldovan banks and 
other financial institutions. 
— Silviu Foca, Director General, Biroul de Credit SRL
The challenge of accessing finance also extends to 
municipalities in Kazakhstan. Urban infrastructure 
is seen as a potential source of private investment 
to help expand basic services, but major regulatory 
obstacles to non-sovereign borrowing and public-
private partnerships put Kazakhstan’s cities at a 
disadvantage. Since 2020, the IFC trust-funded ECA 
Cities II Program26 has helped pave the way for reforms 
to Kazakhstan's municipal borrowing legal framework 
and piloting a commercial subnational financing 
solution. The government also amended the Budget 
Code to allow creditworthy local city governments to 
access long-term commercial finance for sustainable 
infrastructure projects.

In January 2022, MIGA established the Fund for 
Advancing Sustainability (FAS) to deliver technical 
assistance to mitigate risks and improve development 
impacts relating to MIGA projects. FAS is deployed to 
support MIGA’s clients in its strategic focus, including 
climate, gender, fragility, and other vital areas, such 
as environmental and social standards and corporate 
governance. Through FAS, MIGA is able to address 
specific challenges for projects across all sectors, 
including agriculture, manufacturing, telecom, and 
infrastructure, to achieve sustained development 
outcomes. FAS is intended to complement MIGA’s 
existing capacity and make its product offerings more

The Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative 
(We-Fi) FIF hosted by the World Bank, works to 
break down barriers related to finance, market access, 
and capacity to empower women entrepreneurs in 
the developing world. In Bangladesh, for example, 
many women-led businesses have faced significant 
disruptions in supply and demand due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. With support from We-Fi, the World Bank 
implements the Corporate Connect Program jointly 
with local and international partners. The program 
educates and engages larger corporations to stimulate 
corporate sourcing from women-owned businesses in 
Bangladesh, and it champions regulatory reforms to 
sustain these market linkages. 
Funding from We-Fi and FIAS also contributes to an 
IFC project in Colombia that has helped Bancamia, 
the second-largest microfinance institution in the 
country, develop and pilot a plan to increase access 
to finance and banking services to forcibly displaced 
people from Venezuela, particularly women. As of 
June 2022, over 6,300 migrants and returnees have 
opened savings accounts or started lines of credit. 
The project’s success reflects the strong demand for 
access to finance among forcibly displaced people, 
and offers a model for replication in other refugee-
hosting countries.

5.2 Boosting International 
Trade and Integration
International trade is a powerful driver of economic 
development, 
poverty 
reduction, 
and 
financial 
sustainability. Despite these benefits, critics blame 
globalization for losing manufacturing jobs in 
advanced economies, environmental degradation, and 
disruptions to supplies of vital goods, like vaccines. 
Increasing 
geopolitical 
tensions 
prompt 
major 
players to raise barriers to trade and investment and 
to subsidize domestic production of goods deemed 
strategic. The World Bank estimates that a slump in 
investor confidence could push 30–50 million people 
into poverty by 2030, depending on the severity of 
protectionist policies put in place by advanced and 
developing economies.27
Despite these trends, World Bank trust funds continue 
to help countries and communities participate in 
regional and global trading systems. For example, the 
Horn of Africa Umbrella supported the development 
of the East Africa Trade Facilitation Roadmap and its 
adoption by the Finance Ministers of Kenya, Ethiopia, 
Somalia, Djibouti, and South Sudan. The roadmap 
plots a course for coordinated public policy responses 
to development challenges that hamper economic 
growth in the region, and it underpins the Bank’s $325 
million East Africa Regional Trade Facilitation Project 
now under preparation.
Also in East Africa, the Umbrella Facility for Trade 
(UFT) provided technical assistance and capacity 
strengthening to the Government of Kenya to negotiate 
and assess the impacts of new trade agreements 
and changes in regional integration initiatives. This 
included re-negotiating the East African Community’s 
common external tariff, analyzing the economic and 
distributional effects of the African Continental Free 
Trade Area, and assessing the impacts of a free-
trade agreement with the United States. More than 
70 government staff members received training on 
modern trade agreement negotiations.
The Digital Development Partnership (DDP) 
contributes to the Western Africa Regional Digital 
Integration Program, the Bank’s flagship regional 
operation to increase broadband access and usage to 
advance the integration of digital markets in Western 
Africa. DDP funded research to enhance the design of 
program activities to promote financial sustainability 
and resilience of innovators and entrepreneurs in the 
region. Input from over 900 SMEs and 300 digital 
service providers across West Africa, as well as 
entrepreneurship support organizations, yielded useful 
insights into the key challenges within the regional

Trust funds also help build the evidence base to 
solve issues related to remittances, which are vital 
for the global economy and millions of households 
worldwide. Remittance inflows to low and middle-
income economies reached $626 billion in 2022,28 
exceeding foreign direct investment and official 
development assistance. However, remittances often 
come at a high transaction cost for migrants and their 
families. With backing from the Financial Inclusion 
Trust Fund (FINC) and the Payment Systems and 
Remittances Trust Fund (PYMT), the World Bank's 
Remittance Prices Worldwide (RPW) database has 
collected quarterly data on remittance costs since 
2009, covering 367 remittance corridors. The RPW 
serves as the official reference for global remittance 
service cost reduction objectives and is used to track 
progress toward SDGs on remittance costs and to 
inform policy decisions.

As governments and the private sector contend with 
the rising costs of finance, growing debt burdens, 
and increasing inflation, it becomes even more 
important to develop strong, well-regulated local 
capital markets that can promote more resilient and 
sustainable growth. Yet most developing countries 
lack the necessary preconditions for a healthy capital 
market: stable macroeconomic fundamentals, a sound 
banking system, a good institutional and regulatory 
framework, an efficient market infrastructure, and 
sufficient market size. In 2018, the World Bank and 
development partners launched the Joint Capital 
Markets Program (J-CAP) to bring together 
experts from across the Bank to deliver advisory 
services sequenced with investments to support the 
development of local debt and equity capital markets. 
J-CAP launched in 14 countries, including the West 
African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).

In West Africa, the program has focused on 
harmonizing the capital market environment across 
the eight WAEMU countries to expand the domestic 
institutional investor base and develop capital market 
instruments to increase real sector development. 
An improved regulatory framework, issued by the 
regional capital markets authority in January 2022 
with key assistance from J-CAP, enabled the creation 
of local private equity and venture capital funds, 
requiring them to direct at least 70 percent of their 
total investment portfolio to SMEs unlisted on stock 
markets. This will help channel investment capital to 
promising startups and young enterprises that are 
typically too risky for banks. 
5.3 Establishing Regional 
Catastrophe Risk Pools
Climate change and increasingly extreme weather 
events exacerbate the frequency and intensity of 
natural disasters, which have surged over the past 
50 years.29 According to the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO), extreme weather and climate 
and water-related events caused nearly 12,000 
reported disasters between 1970 and 2021, with 
over 2 million deaths and $4.3 trillion in economic 
losses.30 The World Bank is a leader in establishing 
and managing designated facilities and trust funds to 
help countries respond to and recover from natural 
disasters. Regional risk insurance pools are a cost-
efficient means of enhancing countries’ financial 
sustainability and resilience, by providing short-term 
liquidity when an insurance policy is triggered by a 
catastrophic event. 
For example, the Global Shield Financing Facility 
(GSFF), formerly the Global Risk Financing Facility, 
helps to strengthen the financial resilience of 
pastoralists in the Horn of Africa—one of the poorest 
and most fragile regions in the world, with 50 million 
pastoralists among the most vulnerable. When 
drought hits, livestock either die or are sold at rock-
bottom prices. With support from the GSFF, Djibouti, 
Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia have come together to 
pool their drought risk through a regional institution, 
ZEP-RE, and transfer it to the insurance market. By 
March 2023, 159,000 pastoralists (about 1 million 
with dependents) were enrolled in the program 
with a package of drought index insurance, savings, 
digital accounts, and financial literacy. Over half of 
participants (57 percent) are women. The initiative 
also partners with the Consultative Group to Assist 
the Poor (CGAP) to ensure that the savings and 
insurance products meet the needs of women herders 
and service providers are incentivized to deliver.
Our cattle are like our bank 
account. When our livestock is 
affected by drought, it is like 
we have lost that account and 
we are hopeless. Since I joined 
the program and received the 
training, I can now afford to buy 
fodder for my animals.

Countries in Central America and the Caribbean 
are also vulnerable to natural disasters, leading to 
human and economic losses that hinder economic 
growth. The COVID-19 pandemic and global inflation 
crisis have further strained the region's fiscal and 
financial systems, limiting their ability to prepare 
for and respond to future disasters. The Caribbean 
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) 
provides affordable and high-quality catastrophe 
risk coverage and funds technical assistance to 
enable 
participating 
governments 
to 
improve 
disaster preparedness through comprehensive risk 
financing strategies.

Similarly, the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance 
Company (PCRIC) was created to improve access 
to rapid, post-disaster finance for vulnerable Pacific 
Island countries as part of the G7-championed 
InsuResilience Global Partnership and with funding 
from the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and 
Financing Initiative MDTF. The PCRIC is a dedicated 
entity designed to provide disaster and climate-
related insurance to Pacific Island countries and build 
capacity in both the public and private sectors while 
helping to minimize the costs of premiums to support 
the development of disaster risk insurance markets. 
Before the PCRIC’s closure in fiscal 2023, it made full 
insurance payouts within 30 days of the occurrence of 
insured events, and the claims-paying capacity was 
enough to sustain a 1-in-200-year insured loss.

**Image Description:**
The image features a close-up of a man standing behind a large animal with prominent horns, possibly a bull or a cow. The horns of the animal frame the man, appearing in the foreground with a blurred effect. The man is wearing a knit hat that partially covers his eyes and a worn brown vest over a patterned shirt. He has a piece of grass or straw in his mouth.

In the background, there are several other people, mostly out of focus, dressed in various traditional or rural attire, suggesting a communal or market setting. The overall mood is natural and earthy, with soft lighting.

There is no visible text in the image. The layout centers the man framed by the animal's horns, emphasizing a connection between the individual and livestock, which could resonate with themes in an annual development report related to agriculture, rural livelihoods, or pastoral communities.

Financial Information of 
Trust Funds and FIFs 
6
This chapter provides aggregate financial information on the activities of trust funds and FIFs administered individually 
or jointly by IBRD, IFC, MIGA, and ICSID. It looks at five-year trends, from fiscal 2019–23, on trust fund and FIF 
inflows, outflows, and assets under management (Box 6.1)—all of which demonstrate the World Bank's position as 
the partner of choice to advance development agendas in countries, regions, and around the globe. Due to rounding, 
disbursements below $50 million are displayed as $0.00 million and other figures presented in this chapter may not 
add up to totals. 
Definitions of Key Financial Terms
Inflows are cash contributions to trust funds and FIFs, including encashment of 
promissory notes and cash receipts from donors. 
All contributions (cash and promissory notes, net of certain discounts) are reported 
using the historical FX rates at the date of receipt. Amounts to donor balance and 
holding accounts have been excluded. From fiscal 2017 onward, most contributors 
to the Global Fund provide contributions directly to its secretariat, and the trustee 
receives these funds as contributions from the Global Fund Secretariat as a contributor. 
Outflows are disbursements from trust funds and cash transfers from FIFs to 
implementing entities (World Bank excluded) for development activities. For 
accounting purposes, FIF transfers to the World Bank as an implementing entity are 
not included in FIF disbursements; instead, they are transferred and later recorded as 
IBRD/IDA trust fund disbursements.
Assets are funds held in trust (FHIT)—cash, investments, promissory notes—and 
contributions receivable at the end of the fiscal year. “Other” FHIT includes amounts 
held in escrow on behalf of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment 
Dispute (ICSID), donor balance accounts (DBA), balances on administration accounts, 
and unapplied receipts.

Sovereign governments were the main contributors to World Bank trust funds, providing 
90 percent ($35.1 billion) of the cash contributions received for IBRD/IDA trust funds, 67 percent 
($1 billion) received for IFC trust funds, and 56 percent ($27 billion) received for FIFs in fiscal 2019–23.

development partners for World Bank trust funds and FIFs. For IBRD/IDA trust funds, 
the United States was the largest development partner with cumulative cash contributions of 
$21.6 billion, followed by the United Kingdom at $2.3 billion during fiscal 2019–23.
For FIFs, the top 10 sovereign development partners contributed $23.2 billion during fiscal 
2019–23, which accounted for 48 percent of cumulative cash contributions ($48.3 billion). 
The largest contributor was Germany, with contributions of $4.3 billion, followed closely by 
the United States ($3.7 billion).

**Image Description:**
The image is a scatter plot titled "Population in Developing Regions Projected to Increase by Almost 2 Billion Between 2020 and 2050." 

### Layout and Key Elements:
- **X-axis** represents regions: 
  - Sub-Saharan Africa
  - Northern Africa and Western Asia
  - Latin America and the Caribbean
  - Eastern and South-Eastern Asia
  - Central and Southern Asia
  - Oceania
  - Europe
  - Northern America
  
- **Y-axis** represents population in billions, ranging approximately from 0 to 2.5 billion.
  
- The graph shows three sets of data points, represented by different colors and shapes:
  - **Blue circles** indicate population in 2050.
  - **Orange circles** indicate population in 1950.
  - **Dark blue circles** indicate population in 2020.

### Data Points:
- Each region has three corresponding dots representing the population for the years 1950, 2020, and 2050.
- The largest increase in population appears in Sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia.
- Europe and Northern America show smaller population change over the years.
- The increasing trend is clear in developing regions, especially Sub-Saharan Africa, where the 2050 projection is notably higher than 2020.

This graph effectively illustrates projected population growth primarily in developing regions from 2020 to 2050, compared with their populations in 1950.

Implementing Entities, Fiscal 2019–23 ($ Billions)
FIF TRANSFERS32
FIFs remain an important funding source for World Bank trust funds. Transfers from 
FIFs to projects implemented by the IBRD, IDA, and IFC increased to $1 billion in fiscal 
2023 from $0.7 billion in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, the top three transfers were made from 
the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) at $0.3 billion, followed by the Global Partnership for 
Education (GPE) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) at $0.2 billion each. 
On a cumulative basis spanning fiscal 2019–23, the largest transfers to IBRD, IDA, and IFC 
as implementing entities were received from GPE ($1.4 billion), followed by CIF ($0.9 billion) 
and the GEF ($0.7 billion).
32 Transfers to implementing entities include transfers for project preparation, supervision fees, project implementation, and 
special agreement transfers for programs for heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) and Advanced Market Commitments 
(AMC). However, in the case of the Global Fund, there is a lump sum transfer to the secretariat, and the use of the 
transferred funds is determined by the Global Fund.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT 
The World Bank manages the liquid assets of trust funds and FIFs in a single, commingled investment pool that 
provides the following benefits to its participants: 
• A selection of sub-portfolios or model portfolios to accommodate varying liquidity needs and risk 
preferences of different funds managed within a comprehensive risk management framework
• Access to a wide variety of investment products and longer terms of maturity to enhance investment returns 
over time
• Regular review of liquidity needs across funds to optimize investments over the longer term
• Standard and customized environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment solutions and product 
offerings to cater to various sustainable responsible investing (SRI) aspirations of individual funds
These investments earn income based on the trust fund’s share of interest income, realized gains or losses from 
the sale of securities, and unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the asset value held by the pool at 
fair value.

ASSET MIX OF TRUST FUNDS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 
Upon receipt of development partner contributions to a trust fund, the World Bank invests these resources in the 
international capital markets until they are disbursed to final recipients. Trust fund assets are managed with the 
primary investment objective of capital preservation and liquidity on demand. 
The provisions of the World Bank’s General Investment Authorizations for IBRD and IDA also apply to the 
investment of trust fund assets. Accordingly, these assets are managed within conservative overall risk tolerance 
parameters and invested in high-quality securities, which include securities issued by sovereign governments, 
government agencies, and multilateral and other official institutions, asset-backed and agency-guaranteed 
mortgage-backed securities, as well as swaps and a range of derivatives in support of securities investments. 
Subject to the primary investment objective, the asset mix among the investment products authorized by the 
General Investment Authorizations is based on market opportunities available within the applicable risk limits. As 
part of monitoring and financial and risk management oversight, a regular rebalancing of assets is performed to 
ensure that enough liquidity is available to meet disbursement needs.
The Investment Management of World Bank Trust Fund offers more details about how the World Bank manages 
and invests development partner financial resources.
The portfolio asset allocation as of end of fiscal 2023 reflects a conservative investment 
approach and defensive positioning to maintain the portfolio within the policy risk tolerance. 
The portfolio includes a large allocation of 27 percent in cash and money market instruments, 
followed by 23 percent invested in sovereign government bonds, 14 percent in agencies 
bonds, and 13 percent in covered bonds. The rest of the portfolio is invested in sovereign 
guaranteed, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and a small allocation to equities.

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS
Keeping pace with the rapid shift in the global asset management industry toward sustainable and responsible 
investing (SRI), the World Bank is committed to integrating sustainability-related themes in all operational activities, 
including the investment management function entrusted to it by its clients. 
Since July 2019, the Bank Treasury has applied ESG integration as the default SRI approach to the trust fund 
pooled assets under management within the purview of the IBRD/IDA General Investment Authorizations and 
clients’ investment guidelines as stipulated in the Investment Management Agreements. ESG integration is an 
extension of traditional financial analysis that explicitly considers ESG factors in investments.
Further, in response to growing demand from some FIFs for more mission-driven thematic SRI investment 
strategies with sustainable development impacts, the World Bank rolled out the Sustainable Bond Strategy in 
fiscal 2021. It followed a gradual and phased approach, starting with the Sovereign, Supranational, and Agency 
(SSA) universe permissible under the existing Investment Authorizations. As of June 30, 2023, the market value of 
the portfolio invested in the strategy was $440 million, with 94 percent of the portfolio invested in 32 impact bonds 
issued by 21 SSA issuers. The Bank published its first Sustainable Fixed-Income Strategy Impact Report in 2023 to 
highlight specific issuers and holdings, SDG-aligned impact metrics, and project stories (Figure 6.14).
Through a tiered offering of SRI investment approaches, the World Bank, as the trustee for trust funds and FIFs, 
intends to achieve the overarching objective of capital preservation and liquidity on demand. The World Bank 
will continue to explore additional SRI strategies in line with current market practices to meet the evolving SRI 
aspirations and development objectives of development partners.

The office decor includes a motivational poster on the wall behind them with the text: "don't wish for it, work for it." The words "work for it" are highlighted with a turquoise background, and the poster design features a mix of white, yellow, and orange geometric shapes.

The overall layout of the image emphasizes a professional and focused work atmosphere with attention to health safety measures such as face masks. The motivational text in the background supports a theme of diligence and productivity, appropriate for inclusion in an annual development report.

Figure 6.14. Topline Impact Numbers from the Sustainable Fixed-Income 
Strategy Impact Report, World Bank 2023
The strategy uses issuer information for each 
bond to calculate the impact at the issuance 
level, as well as at the holdings level, using 
a prorating approach. The topline impact 
numbers to the right show prorated impact 
attributed to the holdings of the strategy as 
of June 30, 2022.1 This is a very simplified 
representation of the impact that aligns to 
the methodology used by other investors. It 
provides an indication of the scope of impact, 
yet underestimates the actual support since 
only part of the results is reported.
Topline Impact Numbers

**Image Description:**
The image depicts a cityscape with layers of distinct architectural layouts and building types. 

Layout and key elements:
- Foreground: Numerous residential houses predominantly with colorful roofs in shades of red, green, blue, and brown. The houses are separated by trees and greenery, giving the impression of a suburban neighborhood.
- Middle-ground: A line of dense trees forms a natural barrier or green belt, separating the residential area from the urban buildings.
- Background: A collection of modern, high-rise apartment and office buildings dominate the skyline. Among them, a prominent white and blue building with a large blue dome stands out centrally. This building has a modern design with vertical blue stripes and looks like it might hold municipal, cultural, or religious significance.
- On the left side of the image, a tall building prominently displays the text "SIEMENS" in turquoise letters near the top.
- Other smaller signs, such as one partially visible with red text, appear on buildings in the background near the left side.

There is no additional textual information in the image aside from the visible building signs mentioned above. The image overall illustrates a contrast between the suburban residential area in the foreground and the modern urban development in the background, making it suitable for demonstrating urban growth and development trends in an annual report.

**Image Description:**
The image shows a woman sitting indoors with a calm and composed expression. She is wearing a white textured shawl draped over her shoulders and a headscarf with a dark pattern around her head underneath. Her hands are folded lightly in her lap, and she is wearing a ring on one of her fingers.

In the background, there is a blue shelf filled with various household items such as glass jars, containers, and a tea set. The area looks like a modest kitchen or living space with some patterned cloth covering surfaces.

There is no visible text in the image.

This image has a warm and personal feel, capturing the essence of everyday life, likely highlighting the woman’s role or story as part of the annual development report. The lighting is soft, illuminating the subject well against a darker backdrop.
