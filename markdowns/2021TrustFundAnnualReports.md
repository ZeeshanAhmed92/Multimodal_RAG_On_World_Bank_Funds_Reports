### **MESSAGE FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT**

This was a year dominated by COVID-19 and the ensuing global health and economic crisis. The pandemic
has taken lives and disrupted livelihoods in every corner of the world. It has raised the urgency of mitigating
severe economic impacts on poverty and overcoming the dangers of climate change, systemic inequality,
social instability, financial risks, declining growth rates, and conflicts.


The World Bank Group’s ongoing response to the COVID-19 crisis has been massive and decisive, with trust
funds and financial intermediary funds (FIFs) contributing to immediate relief initiatives and providing strategic
support to countries as they rebuild for a resilient recovery. This report highlights the important work trust
funds and FIFs are supporting to help shorten the crisis and lay a strong foundation for a future that is more
prosperous and better prepared for disasters like COVID-19.


Ongoing trust-funded activities are part of the World Bank Group’s efforts to build this foundation of greater
resilience. Looking across the thematic areas of health, climate action, gender, social protection and jobs,
and debt management, this report shows how trust fund and FIF resources—disbursing $51.62 billion from
fiscal years 2017 to 2021—support the World Bank Group’s goals to end extreme poverty and promote shared
prosperity through greener, more inclusive and more resilient development.


Trust funds and FIFs complement the core funding and activities of the World Bank Group, increase the scope
and reach of its activities, and further its knowledge and learning agenda. They help address global and regional
issues that transcend national boundaries and make it possible to support countries, such as non-members
and those in arrears, where the World Bank Group cannot provide financing from its own resources.


This report also examines how the World Bank Group brings value to trust-funded partnerships. Its convening
power, at both the international and country level, optimizes coordinated action on shared development
priorities to achieve impact at scale. Partners benefit from the World Bank Group’s extensive technical expertise,
country experience and supervision capacity, and its ability to monitor and report on results. Ongoing reforms
in trust fund and FIF management also ensure strategic alignment, efficiency, transparency, collaboration, and
predictability in the use of resources. As part of the drive to enhance financial sustainability, new measures are
also being implemented to recover costs in delivering externally funded activities.


Partnerships are at the core of trust fund and FIF success, and we thank all our development
partners, implementing partners, and client countries for their engagement,

collaboration, and dedication to our shared mission and vision. Our work ahead is

more critical than ever. Together, we are building on forward momentum to generate
a resilient recovery that ensures a broad and lasting rise in prosperity for all.

ii WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021 Introduction Introduction iii


### **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:** **TOWARD GREATER RESILIENCE**



The COVID-19 crisis has affected economies around
the world and shocked every sector from health
and the environment to education and jobs to the
macroeconomy and government debt, to name just
a few. The impacts of the pandemic have cascaded
into developing markets and hit vulnerable
populations especially hard. COVID-19 has severely
disrupted access to many essential health services,
particularly in the poorest nations with the most
fragile health systems, and has spawned the worst
crisis to education and learning in a century. Rising
global inequalities, lagging progress in economic
and social development, multiple prolonged violent
conflicts, and increased forced displacement have
all been exacerbated by the pandemic. Women and
girls have borne the brunt of impacts at work and

in the home.



The World Bank Group has mounted a broad
and decisive response to the crisis—the largest
in its history. From April 1, 2020 through June 30,
2021, the World Bank Group committed over $157
billion, including $45.6 billion in financing from

the International Bank for Reconstruction and

Development (IBRD) for middle-income countries,
$53.3 billion in concessional financing and grants
from the International Development Association
(IDA) for the poorest countries, $42.7 billion from the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) to private
companies and financial institutions, $7.6 billion
in guarantees from the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) to support private

sector investors and lenders, and $7.9 billion for

recipient-executed activities supported by trust
fund resources (Figure 0.1).



The World Bank Group’s crisis response has
provided an opportunity to support a strong,
durable recovery that tackles rising poverty and
deepening inequality while addressing both the
immediate devastation wrought by the COVID-19
pandemic and the longer-term challenge of
climate change. Green, resilient, and inclusive
development, or GRID, is the Bank Group’s
renewed and refocused approach to collective
action on interlinking challenges.


This Trust Fund Annual Report, Toward Greater
Resilience, speaks to the many ways that trust
funds and financial intermediary funds (FIFs)
are contributing to the World Bank Group’s
effort to help client countries respond to the
ongoing health and economic crisis stemming
from COVID-19 and recover without significant
setbacks to their long-term development agendas.
Covering July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 (fiscal year
2021 or FY2021), this year’s report provides an
overview of the World Bank Group’s trust funds
and FIFs totaling $40.24 billion in funds held in
trust as of June 30, 2021. The report focuses on
their core strengths, institutional efficiencies and
reforms, key results and impacts from the field,
and financial trends and analytics. Highlighted
activities illustrate the strong commitment and
support of contributing development partners
in addressing the development objectives of

client countries.

##### **TRUST-FUNDED ACTIVITIES** **ADD VALUE**


Trust funds and FIFs are an integral part of the World
Bank Group’s development assistance architecture.
They complement the core funding and activities
of the Bank Group’s institutions—IBRD, IDA, IFC,
and MIGA—by providing financial resources
and contributing to development knowledge
and operational innovations. The flexibility and
responsiveness of trust funds and FIFs help to
expand World Bank Group lending operations,
generate new knowledge, and pilot projects.
They help test cutting-edge approaches for scale
up, advance development finance innovations,

and provide technical assistance, advice, and
training to build stakeholder capacity and enhance
sustainability. Trust funds and FIFs also build on the
World Bank Group’s convening power and global
and local presence to bring value to clients.


In FY2021, the World Bank Group disbursed $3.82
billion in trust fund resources (not including FIFs),
the bulk of which, $3.57 billion, was disbursed by

the World Bank (IBRD and IDA combined). Almost

three-quarters of World Bank-disbursed trust
fund financing, or $2.55 billion, went to recipientexecuted activities on the ground, representing
approximately 5 percent of the World Bank’s total
project disbursements. IDA-only countries were
the largest recipients at 66 percent, followed by ****
IBRD countries (17 percent), IBRD-IDA blend
countries (7 percent), and the balance to global or
regional activities.


The World Bank disbursed the remaining $1.03

billion in trust fund resources toward Bank-executed

activities, including knowledge generation, analytical
activities, and project implementation support.
Over the past five years, trust fund disbursements
for Bank-executed activities have represented 25
percent of the Bank’s administrative expenditures,
including 63 percent of total expenditures for
advisory services and analytics (ASA).

****


IFC Advisory trust funds are a small but critical part
of IFC’s overall budget, and are used to build the
capacity of private sector clients, especially in IDA
countries. IFC trust funds increasingly support IFC’s
Creating Markets Upstream approach to create
bankable projects in the most challenging settings.


****

IFC’s blended concessional finance trust funds are

also an important and growing tool for creating
markets and stimulating development. The strategic
use of concessional funds for projects with high
development impact can catalyze private financing 
that would not otherwise be available and support

the creation of new markets.


World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs also
support global public goods that help advance
key development issues that transcend national
boundaries, including climate change, fragility, and



pandemic preparedness and response. Many FIFs
look to the World Bank Group as an implementing
partner of choice. Trust funds and FIFs also allow
a broader pool of contributors, including nongovernmental entities, to channel funds toward
World Bank efforts to enhance global public goods.


Moreover, trust-funded activities allow the World

Bank Group to provide development resources

to non-member countries, countries in arrears,

and non-sovereign entities that cannot receive
Bank Group financing. MIGA, for example, works
with development partners to leverage its limited
resources and to increase the risk appetite of
private investors in challenging environments.
By collaborating with development partners to ****
establish specialized guarantee trust funds, MIGA
mobilizes guarantee capacity in high-risk states
affected by fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV),
where its operations would be limited.


IBRD/IDA trust fund grants are also a critical
financing source for investments and technical
assistance for recipient-executed activities in FCV
situations. In FY2021, about 50 percent of total trust
fund disbursements for recipient-executed activities
were made to FCV-affected countries, concentrated
in five locations: Afghanistan, Sudan, West Bank and
Gaza, Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic


****

of the Congo. Effective implementation of these
activities is subject to the shifting circumstances on
the ground in some of these countries.

##### **TRUST-FUNDED ACTIVITIES** **HELP BUILD RESILIENCE**


****

Trust funds and FIFs are making important
contributions to all three stages of the World Bank
Group’s pandemic response: relief, restructuring,
and resilient recovery. This report sheds light on 
the ways in which trust-funded activities are fasttracking funding to emergency needs, boosting
support for the most vulnerable, and extending the
World Bank Group’s reach to help countries around
the world end the pandemic and emerge stronger,
more united, more equitable, and more prepared
for future challenges. By the end of FY2021, IBRD/



IDA trust funds had committed $1.13 billion to 248 ****

World Bank operations that are helping countries
respond directly to the COVID-19 crisis. They are
enhancing access to lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines
and treatment, and keeping students learning and
governments solvent, among many other actions.


As the Bank Group looks ahead with its GRID
approach, it brings into focus progress already
being made in strengthening resilience across
systems and society. The report showcases results

stories from the field that illustrate how, over the

past five years, trust funds and FIFs have supported
World Bank Group projects and programs in health,
climate action, gender, social protection and jobs, ****
and debt management—all essential building blocks
for greater resilience.


- In Cambodia, the Health Equity and Quality
Improvement Program (H-EQIP) Multi-Donor
Trust Fund is driving reforms across the health
sector that have helped to reduce the proportion ****
of households vulnerable to high health care
costs by 43 percent from 2015 to 2020.


- In Colombia, funding from the Global
Environment Facility (GEF) has played a
critical role in reducing deforestation, conserving
biodiversity, and fostering climate resilience in
the Amazon, including piloting a communitybased approach to land-use planning that the
Government of Colombia is scaling up across

the Colombian Amazon.




- **** In East Africa, the Umbrella Facility for Gender
Equality (UFGE) has funded research and a pilot
program that is showing how digital financial
service providers can tailor their product
offerings and marketing to attract more
women in agriculture.


- In Zambia, the Girls’ Education and Women’s

Empowerment and Livelihood (GEWEL) MultiDonor Trust Fund is helping to expand the
successful Social Cash Transfer Program, which
seeks to reach 30 percent of the Zambian
population and 50 percent of the poor by 2022.


- **** In Georgia, ongoing engagement through the
Debt Management Facility (DMF) had enabled
the country to build a framework for greater
resilience in government debt management, so
that it was able to respond effectively when the
COVID-19 pandemic shocked the economy.


- **** In the Middle East and North Africa, funding

from IFC’s MENA Micro, Small and Medium

Enterprises (MSME) 2.0 Trust Fund and the
Partnership for Resilient Efficient and Sustainable

 SMEs Facility supported the development of an

interactive webinar series that is helping MSMEs

increase their business resilience in the wake of

the COVID-19 crisis.

combining existing IBRD/IDA trust funds, as well
as establishing new programs. This has enabled the
World Bank to mobilize resources more strategically,
efficiently, and effectively to help client countries
achieve their development objectives.


A new Cost Recovery Framework for IBRD/IDA
trust funds was launched in FY2021. Building
on the previous one, this framework is simpler,
easier to communicate and more predictable. The
new framework aims to support and maintain the
budget sustainability, including implementing
targeted efficiencies and economies of scale, and
increasing cost recovery. The new framework also
increases the recovery of the World Bank’s indirect

costs associated with trust funds over time, while

maintaining some level of contribution from the
Bank in recognition of the partnership nature of

trust funds.


IFC has initiated a proactive and strategic review
of its fundraising efforts and use of trust funds to
ensure alignment with its 3.0 Strategy and Creating
Markets Upstream approach in support of private
sector investment opportunities. The trust fund
reform process has centered around IFC’s new
corporate Funding Needs Assessment (FNA), which
has allowed IFC to streamline governance and align
development partner fundraising with its strategic
goals and ensure development partner funds are
appropriately balanced with IFC’s resources. By the
end of FY2021, the FNA was fully integrated into
IFC’s annual budgeting process, thereby facilitating
more focused strategic partnerships with
development partners.


##### **REFORMS MAKE FUNDING** **MORE EFFECTIVE**

The World Bank Group is organized to work across
the entire development spectrum, at the country,
regional, and global levels, to facilitate coordinated
action for solutions that support its mission to end
extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity.
The Bank Group’s increased presence in more than
160 offices worldwide helps to understand better,
work more effectively with, and provide more timely
services to its partners in those client countries.
This geographic spread—combined with a renewed
delivery model that strengthens cooperation among
sectoral and regional teams across the World Bank
Group and increases focus on fragile states—help to
strategically align resources with the Bank Group’s
priorities and rising demand from client countries to
achieve better development outcomes.


The role of trust funds has evolved dramatically
during the last few decades, and the World Bank
Group has undertaken initiatives and reforms to



continuously improve the effectiveness of trust

fund resources and activities. The World Bank’s

latest reform to transition the IBRD/IDA trust

fund portfolio into fewer and larger Umbrella 2.0
Programs aims to deliver transformative solutions for
client countries and development partners through
improved strategic alignment, increased efficiency,
reduced fragmentation and transactions costs, and
enhanced management oversight.


For development partners, the reform elevates the
World Bank-donor partnership to focus on strategy,
enables collective action at scale on development
challenges, supports knowledge exchange, and
strengthens results reporting and visibility. For
clients, the reform facilitates better alignment of
trust fund activities with country priorities and
enables trust fund resources to be better integrated
in World Bank country programs.


During FY2021, the World Bank continued
the transition to 72 Umbrella 2.0 Programs by
consolidating, redesigning, rebranding, and/or



![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-6-0.png)

![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-6-1.png)

The World Bank Group also began implementing an
updated FIF Management Framework in FY2020.
This is helping to increase upstream engagement
with development partners and shape the dialogue
around the continuum of financing instruments
available to meet development objectives and keep
aid fragmentation in check. Discussions around new
proposals now systematically include consideration
of building on the existing aid architecture, including
existing FIFs. No new FIFs have been established

since FY2018.

##### **READING THIS REPORT**

This report and its accompanying volumes delve
deep into the contributions of World Bank Group
trust funds and FIFs during the past five years
(FY2017–21). It has the following structure:


Chapter 1 explains institutional reforms and how
trust fund programs add value to the World Bank
Group mission and complement the work of its
various arms. It examines how the Bank Group’s
convening power and technical capacities
strengthen international partnering initiatives to
achieve collective goals more efficiently than one
partner could achieve by itself.


Chapter 2 looks at how trust funds and FIFs have
supported the World Bank Group’s response to the
COVID-19 crisis. Fast-acting and targeted trustfunded activities have helped in relief, restructuring,
and resilient recovery efforts to save lives, protect
the poor and vulnerable, ensure sustainable
business growth and job creation, and strengthen
policies, institutions, and investments.


Chapter 3 takes a broader view to showcase how
trust funds and FIFs have supported World Bank
Group public and private sector efforts in health,
climate action, gender, social protection and
jobs, and debt management during the past five
years. These themes illustrate the diversity and
strategic value of trust-funded activities in building
the foundations for greater resilience now and

into the future.



Chapter 4 provides financial information and
analytics on the activities of World Bank Group
trust funds and FIFs, as well as externally financed
outputs. It examines five-year trends on trust

fund and FIF inflows, outflows, and assets under

management—all of which demonstrate the World
Bank Group’s position as the partner of choice in
advancing development agendas in countries,
regions, and around the globe.

of the World Bank’s analytical work and provide
funding to pilot innovative ideas, support the quality
and development impact of operations, and make it
possible for the Bank Group to provide development

resources to non-member countries, countries in

arrears, and other institutions that cannot receive

Bank Group financing.


Trust funds are used to mobilize development
finance. For countries lacking the development
finance to achieve their own goals, trust funds
complement IBRD and IDA in helping governments
build their capacity to mobilize revenue, manage
public expenditure and public debt, and improve
their procurement and public financial management
systems. Trust funds support the development of

innovative financial solutions and the mobilization of

new, nontraditional sources of development finance.


Trust funds are used to address global and
regional issues that transcend national boundaries,
such as climate change, communicable diseases,
and other shared challenges. Individual countries
can be reluctant to borrow for county-level
investments that contribute to the provision of
global or regional public goods, the benefits

of which transcend national boundaries. Trust

funds facilitate assembling global and national
stakeholders into partnerships to support the global
aspects of public goods. For example, trust funds
are helping to boost climate resilience by scaling
up the implementation of renewable energy and
energy efficiency measures. They are also helping
to enhance countries’ response to the COVID-19
pandemic and preparedness for future pandemics.

##### **1.2 WORLD BANK GROUP AND** **TRUST FUNDS**


The World Bank Group consists of five institutions:

the International Bank for Reconstruction and

Development (IBRD), the International Development

Association (IDA), the International Finance

Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID). IBRD and IDA (collectively the “World Bank”)

## T rust funds are financing instruments that accept contributions from one or more

donors that are held in trust by the World

Bank Group as a trustee and disbursed
according to the provisions of the Bank
Group’s Administrative Agreement with

the donor(s) to each trust fund. Trust funds

often create platforms and partnerships for
financial, knowledge and other forms of

collaboration between the Bank Group, its

donors, its client countries, and others at

the global, regional, and country levels.


Trust funds combine the advantages of multilateral
aid (such as larger geographic presence, economies
of scale, lower administrative costs, and proven
implementation capacity) with those of bilateral
assistance (targeted assistance in areas such as
fragile situations where donors have limited or
no presence). Trust funds can also bring down
transactions costs and reduce the proliferation of
bilateral programs. Channeling trust funds through
multilateral institutions, like the World Bank Group,
can also facilitate the integration of global priorities
into country programs.

##### **1.1 VALUE PROPOSITION OF** **TRUST FUNDS**


Trust funds support the achievement of the World
Bank Group’s goals to end extreme poverty and
promote shared prosperity in a sustainable way
by providing financial resources, contributing to
the knowledge agenda, and building on the Bank
Group’s convening power and global and local
presence to contribute to country, regional, and
global development.


Trust funds complement core World Bank Group
financing. Trust funds enhance global, regional,
and country-level knowledge and provide targeted
support to clients to complement the World Bank
Group’s own financing. They fund nearly two-thirds


administer the largest number of trust funds. IFC and
MIGA manage fewer trust funds both in number and
volume. IBRD also manages financial intermediary
funds (FIFs)—tailored financing mechanisms that
enable the international community to provide a
coordinated response to global priorities.


IBRD/IDA TRUST FUNDS


IBRD is the largest development bank in the world.
It provides loans, guarantees, risk management
products, and advisory services to middle-income
and creditworthy low-income countries, and
coordinates responses to regional and global
challenges. IDA, the Bank Group’s fund for the
poorest countries, aims to reduce poverty by
providing zero to low-interest loans and grants
for programs that boost economic growth, reduce
inequalities, and improve people’s living conditions.


As of June 30, 2021, the World Bank had 529 active

trust fund accounts at the trustee level, into which

donors make their contributions. The World Bank

managing unit for each trust fund account disburses
these resources to support either Bank-executed
activities or recipient-executed activities.


Bank-executed (BE) activities are performed by
the World Bank, and constitute part of the Bank’s
work program. Therefore, trust fund disbursements
for BE activities are comparable to and contribute
toward the Bank’s administrative expenditures. BE
activities support the World Bank’s work over the
entire range of the project cycle, from upstream
activities (such as research, learning, and advisory
services and analytics, or ASA) to country-level
technical assistance and capacity building to support
for project preparation, design, implementation,
and impact evaluations (Box 1.1). In FY2021, trust
fund disbursements for BE activities represented a
quarter of the Bank’s administrative expenditures,
including 63 percent of total ASA expenditures.



![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-10-0.png)

Recipient-executed (RE) activities support
projects that are typically executed by countrylevel recipients, similar to IBRD or IDA financing.
Like IBRD/IDA projects, Bank staff appraise and
supervise the projects to ensure that the recipients

execute them in accordance with World Bank

policies and procedures. The recipients who execute
these projects are mostly sovereign governments
or their agencies, as well as UN agencies or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Therefore,
trust fund disbursements for RE activities form part
of the Bank’s investment project portfolio.


Trust fund support for RE activities enables the Bank
to expand and complement its lending program
in several contexts, such as situations of fragility,
conflict, and violence (FCV) or when the Bank’s

resources are limited by IDA’s assistance envelope
or by the availability of IBRD’s lending resources. RE
grants can also extend the Bank’s reach to countries

in arrears, non-members (such as the West Bank







and Gaza), and non-state recipients, such as civil
society organizations (CSOs), which cannot receive
direct funding through regular Bank instruments
like IBRD loans or IDA credits and grants. They also
complement IBRD and IDA in providing immediate
assistance in response to emergencies, natural
disasters, and countries dealing with an influx
of refugees.


Trust-funded RE activities can either be stand
alone grants or provide co-financing to projects
being financed by the World Bank, IFC, FIFs, or
other donor financing. In many instances the RE
grants effectively lower the interest rate charged
to borrowers. They are typically accompanied by
trust-funded BE activities that support the Bank’s
preparation, appraisal, and implementation of the
RE grants. Trust-funded RE activities represented
5 percent of World Bank disbursements to client

countries in FY2021.

Going forward, MIGA plans to augment these
two existing trust funds with two new trust

fund accounts: one focused on renewable

energy and another on advisory services to
address the critical sustainability issues of
governance, gender, and environmental and
social compliance. All four trust funds will be
brought under one coordinating MIGA Strategic
Priorities Framework to ensure internal alignment
and a consistent and coordinated approach.


FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY FUNDS


FIFs are important tools in the development finance
toolbox, offering customized financing platforms
for partnership programs and special financing
mechanisms that can catalyze a variety of public
and private resources in support of international
initiatives. The World Bank supports FIFs
through tailored administrative, financial, legal, or
operational services.



IFC TRUST FUNDS


IFC advances economic development and improves
the lives of people by encouraging the growth of the
private sector in developing countries. IFC does
this by creating new markets, mobilizing other
investors, and sharing expertise—all of which help
to create jobs and raise living standards, especially
for the poor and vulnerable. Private investment and
private sector solutions are essential to meet the
World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme
poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity,
especially given the longer-term economic impact

of COVID-19.


IFC’s Creating Markets Upstream approach
envisions a continuum of work, beginning with
Advisory services (to help create the conditions for
new investment through reform and development
of promising business sectors) and continuing with
support for developing specific projects in which
IFC may invest.


Through Advisory programs, IFC works with
clients, including companies, financial institutions,
industries, and governments, to transform ideas into
increased private sector investment, green growth,
inclusive job creation, and bankable projects. IFC
trust funds are the main instrument for financing IFC
Advisory services, and increasingly its Upstream
agenda, with funding coming from development
partners, IFC, and its clients. While donor trust funds
are an important contributor to delivery of IFC’s
strategy, they account for a small portion of IFC’s

total resources.


Based on data for FY2020 and 2021, partner funding
accounted for 13 to 15 percent of total annual

resources. As of June 30, 2021, IFC had 158 active

donor trust fund accounts, 54 percent of which were
focused on IDA countries. IFC’s Advisory portfolio
had 806 projects spanning 100 countries, with

disbursements of more than $1.3 billion over the

past five years.



IFC uses blended finance to crowd in private sector
financing that would otherwise not be available.
Relatively small amounts of concessional donor
funds allow to mitigate specific investment risks and
help rebalance risk-reward profiles of pioneering,
high-impact investments so that these have the
potential to become commercially viable over time.
IFC takes a disciplined and targeted approach to
blended finance governance, including following key
blended finance principles for development finance

institutions: rationale for blended concessional

finance, crowding-in and minimum concessionality,
commercial sustainability, reinforcing markets, and
promoting high standards.


IFC’s blended finance portfolio encompassed 20
donor-funded programs at the end of FY2021,
compared to 10 programs at the end of FY2017, with

$1.45 billion in active contributions from 11 donors,

including the IDA Private Sector Window. [1]


MIGA TRUST FUNDS


MIGA facilitates foreign direct investments into
developing countries by providing guarantees
(political risk insurance and credit enhancement)
to investors and lenders. MIGA guarantees protect
investments against noncommercial risks and can
help investors obtain access to funding sources
with improved financial terms and conditions.


MIGA has two active trust fund accounts that help to
expand its guarantee work in FCV countries where
MIGA’s operations would otherwise be limited: the
Conflict-Affected and Fragile Economies Facility

and the West Bank and Gaza Trust Fund. These

promote the stability and growth of FCV countries
by catalyzing private capital flows from investors
and financial institutions to these countries through
the mobilization of political risk insurance products
from both MIGA and the global political risk
insurance industry.



Most often launched at high-level, multilateral
forums, FIFs enable the international community
to provide a direct and coordinated response to
global priorities. They serve as multi-contributor
collaboration platforms, typically governed
independently, that focus on providing large-scale
pooled funding in support for global public goods,
such as preventing communicable diseases,
responding to climate change, and food security.


The World Bank manages a large and diverse
portfolio of FIFs. It facilitates the establishment and
operation of FIFs by offering to perform a set of roles
and responsibilities tailored to the circumstances
of each FIF. The World Bank is a valued partner
as a trustee for FIFs, building on well-established
financial, investment management, and accounting
platforms developed over the past two decades,
and on specialized legal and treasury services. In

addition, the World Bank often hosts FIF secretariats,

serves as an implementing entity for many FIFs, and
in some cases hosts an evaluation office (Table 1.1).



1 As part of the 18 th replenishment of IDA, the World Bank Group created a $2.5 billion IDA-IFC-MIGA Private Sector Window, to catalyze
private sector investment in IDA-only countries, with a focus on FCV-affected states. The window became operational on July 1, 2017
and is administered as a trust fund.

##### **1.3 ENHANCING** **EFFECTIVENESS THROUGH** **INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES**

WORLD BANK


The IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio upholds the
World Bank’s country-based, demand-driven
delivery model, in which the Bank strives to
achieve its developmental goals through activities
at the country level, based on decisions made by
sovereign country authorities. This requires deep
and customized analysis of the economic and
social conditions in each country, and a careful
assessment of government priorities and of the
Bank Group’s comparative advantage within
each country.


The World Bank has realigned senior responsibilities
within its Global Practices to strengthen links and
cooperation between sectoral and regional teams,
while maintaining the flexibility of the renewed
delivery model. This is also expected to enhance
contestability as well as the quality of the Bank’s
knowledge products.



The World Bank served as limited trustee and/

or financial or treasury manager for 27 FIFs that
were active during FY2021. Of these, the World
Bank provided the legal personality for 19 FIFs,

hosted the secretariats for 18 FIFs, and served as

an implementing entity for 20 FIFs. The World Bank
takes on an implementing entity role for most FIFs
whose secretariat is hosted by the World Bank. The
World Bank also acts as an implementing entity for



three FIFs with external secretariats: Climate Risk

and Early Warning Systems (CREWS), the Green
Climate Fund (GCF), and the Guyana REDD+

Investment Fund (GRIF). Two FIFs were closed in

FY2021: the Advanced Market Commitments (AMC)

for Pneumococcal Vaccines and the Pandemic

Emergency Financing Facility (PEF), reducing the

total number of FIFs to 25 at the end of FY2021.



a For CIF, this amount represents pledges since inception


FIFs financed a significant portion (28 percent)
of total RE disbursements to project supervision
by the World Bank over the last five years. During
FY2017–21, the largest FIF contributors to Banksupervised RE activities were the Global Partnership
for Education (GPE) ($1.22 billion), the Climate

Investment Funds (CIF) ($0.98 billion), and the

Global Environment Facility (GEF) ($0.75 billion).


The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program
(GAFSP) launched its FY2020–25 replenishment
cycle in October 2020, during which it received
$300 million in pledges for the first year of the
replenishment period, with the goal of receiving $1.5
billion over the full replenishment period (Table 1.2).
In June 2021, donors announced plans to commit up
to $2 billion to CIF to support its new Accelerating
Coal Transition initiative. Donors also pledged $4

billion to the GPE at the Global Education Summit

in July 2021.



6 WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021 Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships 7


As part of this realignment, a large portion of the
IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio has been remapped
to the Regions. This move, along with the
continuing efforts of operational business units to

consolidate their trust funds into fewer Umbrella

2.0 Programs (Section 1.4), is enabling the Bank to
mobilize resources more efficiently and effectively
to help client countries achieve their development
objectives, including the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). Larger, consolidated
programs have greater flexibility to be strategically
aligned and responsive to country needs. The
Bank will be able to integrate trust fund activities
into its annual strategy and planning processes,
intermediating the supply of trust fund resources
managed by Global Practices, and ensuring this is
informed by client needs garnered from the Regions’
engagement with client countries.


A new Cost Recovery Framework for trust funds
went into effect on January 1, 2021. Consistent with
guidance from the Executive Board and feedback
received from development partners and staff, this
framework is simpler, easier to communicate and
more predictable than the previous one. It aims
to support and maintain budget sustainability,
including implementing targeted efficiencies and
economies of scale and increasing cost recovery.


****

The new framework also increases the recovery

of the Bank’s indirect costs associated with trust

funds over time while maintaining some level of
contribution from the Bank in recognition of the
partnership nature of this instrument.


IFC


Since launching its Creating Markets strategy in

December 2016, IFC has embarked on a series of

internal reforms that have strengthened World Bank
Group collaboration while taking a more focused
approach to market creation. IFC’s partners will
play an increasingly important role, by providing
funding to support sector transformation and
capacity building and through blended finance. IFC



is also changing the way it identifies partner funding
needs and develops funding arrangements with
development partners.


In FY2020, IFC embarked on a trust fund reform

process centered around a new corporate
Funding Needs Assessment (FNA). It has
streamlined governance to align development
partner fundraising with IFC’s strategic goals
and ensure development partner funds are
appropriately balanced with IFC’s resources.
By the end of FY2021, the FNA had been fully
integrated into IFC’s annual budgeting process to
ensure alignment with country strategies.


IFC’s new approach to fundraising for its trust
funds works to ensure all aspects of the business
are addressing key development challenges. This
approach delivers a number of advantages:


- Enables more focused strategic partnerships
and coordinated engagement with its
development partners


- Presents a holistic view of IFC’s activities across

various themes and regions to ensure alignment
with partners’ strategic priorities


- Improves collaboration with the World Bank


- **** Increases efficiencies in the areas of trust funds,
particularly in preparing proposals for partners
and in allocating funds


FIF MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK


The World Bank updated its FIF Management
Framework in 2019 in response to a number of
issues arising from the rapid growth in the FIF
portfolio from nine to 27 FIFs between 2008 and
2018. This growth added to the fragmentation
and complexity of the aid architecture, with some
unintended consequences for clients. FIFs can also
raise significant risks for the Bank in the different
roles it plays and at various points in their lifecycles.



The primary objective of the updated FIF
Management Framework has been to raise
awareness of the challenges of some FIFs in
responding to calls for a collective response across
the development community and to put forward
more concrete actions to address them, including
the following:


- Strengthening FIF selectivity, in part, by providing
a menu of options that the World Bank Group
could support to respond to global calls for
collective action and by reserving new FIFs

for situations where there are no reasonable

alternatives.


- Deepening application of a risk-based approach
for approval of new and restructured FIFs and in
relation to major changes during a FIF’s lifecycle.


- Providing the World Bank Group’s Board with
more regular information on FIFs, including
new FIFs under development, FIFs that seek
restructuring, and information on the FIF
portfolio as a whole.


- Clarifying the Bank Group’s expectations and
accountabilities in FIFs, particularly as the host of
FIF secretariats and as an implementing entity.


In FY2020, the World Bank’s Development Finance

**** Vice Presidency (DFi) led the implementation of the

framework by working in close consultation with
other Vice-Presidential Units throughout the Bank.
This involved the following actions:


Policy amendments. The World Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors approved a new Trust Fund
Policy (OP 14.40) in FY2021 and Management
will issue a series of policy documents for staff in
FY2022 that will further support its implementation.


FIF directives, procedures, and guidance notes.

Extensive work has been undertaken to translate

the direction of the Management Framework into
updated FIF directives, procedures and guidance,

which will be formalized in FY2022.



![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-13-0.png)

****



Increasing FIF selectivity and oversight.
Since FY2020, early discussions have been
held systematically with internal and external
counterparts on the most appropriate mechanism

**** for new high-profile initiatives. In each case to date,

it has been agreed that there was no need for a
new FIF, but rather, objectives could be achieved as
well or better through alternative options, including
existing FIFs.


Increasing information sharing. In line with the
commitment in the FIF Management Framework to
increase information sharing on the FIF portfolio, the
Bank presented key developments at the Annual
Meetings and Trust Fund Forum meetings in FY2020
and 2021. This included sharing references to recent

reviews and evaluations of FIFs and information on

upcoming replenishments. This Trust Fund Annual
Report maintains the Bank’s commitment to provide
at least annual reporting on the FIF portfolio.

2.0 Program reform, and program managers were
convened as a network for peer learning and mutual
support. In FY2022, a series of policy documents
for staff will be issued pursuant to the new Trust
Fund Policy that the World Bank’s Executive Board
approved in FY2021.


As the Bank’s Practice Groups, Regions, and
Development Economics Vice Presidency transition
to a more strategic trust fund architecture, FY2022
will see an increased focus on improving the
upstream integration of trust fund resources in the
Bank’s planning cycle.


##### **1.4 TRANSITIONING TO** **UMBRELLA 2.0 PROGRAMS**

A 2017 review of the IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio
revealed significant fragmentation, with about 70
percent of the trust fund accounts contributing
to only around 7 percent of the overall trust fund

resources. The World Bank’s current reform of its trust

fund portfolio through fewer and larger Umbrella 2.0
Programs aims at delivering transformative solutions
for client countries and for development partners
through improved strategic alignment, increased
efficiency, and enhanced oversight.


Umbrella 2.0 Programs are more strategically aligned
with Bank priorities and are expected to increase
the use of development partners’ contributions to
achieve better outcomes for client countries. During

FY2021, the World Bank continued the transition

to Umbrella 2.0 Programs by consolidating,
redesigning, rebranding, and/or combining existing
IBRD/IDA trust funds, as well as establishing

new programs.


ROADMAP TO A LESS FRAGMENTED

TRUST FUND PORTFOLIO


The role of trust funds has evolved dramatically
during the last few decades, and the World

Bank has undertaken initiatives and reforms to
promote continuous improvement in the efficiency,
strategic alignment, and robust oversight of trust
fund resources and the activities they support.
Prior reforms had enabled significant progress in
transitioning trust funds to World Bank operational,
financial, and administrative controls, including
implementation of the trust fund fiduciary
framework, which is now fully mainstreamed into
regular business processes.


The current trust fund reform aims to reduce

fragmentation of trust funds. Its cornerstone is
organizing the trust fund portfolio around a limited
number of Umbrella 2.0 Programs. These are
strongly aligned with the World Bank’s priorities and
seek to enhance the effectiveness of development



resources by strengthening internal oversight and
integration with the Bank’s strategy and planning
processes while further reducing transactions costs

for mutual benefit.


The process to transition the IBRD/IDA trust fund
portfolio to one based on Umbrella 2.0 Programs
began in early 2020 following World Bank Senior
Management endorsement of the reform vision—
the culmination of a three-year, Bank-wide effort to
define the design and implementation of the trust
fund reform. Through this transition, the Bank is
reducing the number of IBRD/IDA trust funds from
a fragmented portfolio of 529 trust found accounts
to 72 proposed Umbrella 2.0 Programs.


Each of the World Bank’s Global Practices and

Regions prepared “roadmaps” in FY2020 to identify
a future trust fund portfolio architecture that would
support strategically driven fundraising for their
objectives and priorities. By the end of FY2021,
72 programs were identified, of which 48 were
confirmed to meet the Umbrella 2.0 Principles (Box
1.2). The complete list of Umbrella 2.0 Programs is

available in Annex C.


The reform has benefited from extensive

engagement with internal and external stakeholders
and funding partners, generating many valuable
recommendations on addressing the challenges
and opportunities. In FY2021, “Deep Dives” with
donor agencies, consultations, and events at
the World Bank–International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Annual and Spring Meetings and regular
communication buttressed development partner
support and buy-in.


Internally, continued engagement across the
World Bank’s Global Practices and Regions
helped maintain internal momentum and enabled
continued roll-out of the reforms. Staff training was
modernized and updated to reflect the Umbrella

KEY FEATURES OF

UMBRELLA 2.0 PROGRAMS


Umbrella 2.0 Programs embody a flexible approach
to trust fund organization and management that
enables development partners and the World Bank
to partner and finance mutual priorities. Designed
to address the persistent challenge of a large and
fragmented trust fund portfolio (many small funds
with highly customized features), Umbrella 2.0
Programs strengthen the link between funding and
the strategic priorities of the World Bank, its clients
and partners, and promote impact at scale.


A trust fund portfolio grounded in Umbrella 2.0
Programs means fewer, larger, more strategically
aligned funding initiatives. The umbrella architecture
also upholds the Bank’s country-based, demanddriven delivery model and takes advantage of recent
corporate realignments that deepen coordination
between World Bank Regions and Global Practices.


Each Umbrella 2.0 Program is anchored by a primary
multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) and, in some cases,

may include associated trust funds (Figure 1.1). In

all cases, the anchor MDTF and the associated

trust funds retain common governance, results
framework, and reporting in the new umbrella
program. The anchor MDTF is a programmatic
trust fund with a relatively broad thematic or
geographic scope.



Umbrella 2.0 Programs offer options for
development partners who are interested in
supporting a specific theme or geographic area.
These options can accommodate situations where
development partners are unable to contribute
to the main MDTF due to their internal policies
or regulations that require dedicated financial
reporting to track their contributions. Such situations
are handled by establishing separate associated
trust funds, which support activities within the
geographic and thematic scope of the umbrella.


The overarching development objective of an
Umbrella 2.0 Program is that of the anchor MDTF.
An Umbrella 2.0 Program can be global, regional,
or single country in scope and can support one
or more priority areas of a World Bank Global
Practice or Region as set out in its business plan.
Associated trust funds support the Umbrella 2.0
Program development objective and contribute to
the overarching results framework of the Umbrella
2.0 Program. They have a thematic and geographic
scope that is within the scope of the anchor MDTF.



Umbrella 2.0 Programs provide scale and efficiency
for enhanced development impact and effectiveness,
by offering the following benefits:


A more strategic way to partner with the
World Bank and to finance priorities. Umbrella
2.0 Programs offer an approach to organizing and
managing trust funds in support of one or more
shared strategic priority areas. Their broad scope
and clear strategic focus elevate the dialogue with
partners around shared priorities and mutually
desired outcomes, while accommodating partners’
interests and aligning with the World Bank’s
planning and budgeting framework.


Increased access to the World Bank’s Senior

Management in the context of high-level policy
and strategy dialogue. Umbrella 2.0 Programs
provide greater opportunities for development
partners and the World Bank to work together
strategically and efficiently and deliver better
results for clients. A single governance structure
for all funds in a program brings the World Bank’s



Senior Management and partners to the same
table around common development objectives,
helps avoid fragmentation of resources, and
increases efficiency.


Opportunities to collectively address global
and local development challenges and achieve
meaningful results at scale. Through participation
in the Partnership Council, development partners
review progress against the unified results
framework; provide strategic advice on setting
priorities, including adjusting to changes in the local
or global context; and collaborate in and benefit
from knowledge-sharing activities. This strategic,
program-level dialogue allows the World Bank and
partners to work together to help advance policy
dialogue and to ensure that individual activities are
aligned around common outcomes. The Partnership
Council endorses the Umbrella 2.0 Program’s
annual work program and budget after which
the World Bank allocates program resources to

individual activities.



12 WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021 Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships 13


During FY2021, the FIAS team updated its strategy
for FY2022–26, with a pipeline of projects in support
of IFC’s Creating Markets Upstream agenda. FIAS
will be the fundraising vehicle of choice for IFC
Advisory services projects at the preparatory end,
what IFC calls “Creating Markets with Sector

Interventions.” These involve sectoral or market
wide interventions that will facilitate private sector
investment and for which IFC could be a potential
financing partner.


LEARNING FROM UMBRELLA

2.0 PROGRAMS


****


The transition to a trust fund portfolio based on
Umbrella 2.0 Programs is an iterative process that
began in FY2019 with a handful of pilot programs.
These have helped the World Bank to learn by
doing and to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach
in designing umbrella programs. The pilot phase
has given way to the launch of full-fledged
Umbrella 2.0 Programs.


Table 1.3 features nine recently established programs
that are implementing the Umbrella 2.0 principles,
including governance arrangements, preferencing,
results frameworks, reporting, and communications.
Their implementation experiences offer lessons that
can help guide the continuing transition process.
These and other lessons from early Umbrella 2.0
Programs continue to be collected to develop
expanded knowledge-sharing activities.


Each of these programs began their Umbrella 2.0
journey from a different starting point and each
is at a different stage of implementation. The
featured programs have diverse origins, including
long-standing legacy programs, restructuring of
existing programs, consolidation and mergers of
existing programs, and new programs being built
from scratch. Their objectives are well aligned
with the GRID approach of green, resilient, and
inclusive development. More insights are detailed
in the accompanying [Lessons from the Umbrella](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/trust-fund-annual-report-2021)

[2.0 Transition.](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/trust-fund-annual-report-2021)



Improved narrative and results reporting and
greater attention to communications and visibility
for development partners. The Results Framework
for each Umbrella 2.0 Program is developed in
consultation with development partners. This covers
activities funded by all trust funds in a program.
The results framework is the key monitoring tool to
assess how individual activities are contributing to
a program’s overall development objectives. Results
progress reporting is provided at the Umbrella 2.0
Program level and may highlight contributions from
associated trust funds in a comprehensive report.


**** Increased access to knowledge sharing
opportunities on key development issues.
Umbrella 2.0 Programs develop Communication
and Visibility Plans (CVP) that are discussed with
the Partnership Council. The CVP ensures that the
strategic communication needs of each Umbrella
2.0 Program are considered and implemented.
This may include stakeholder analysis, audience
segmentation, key messaging and channel selection,
and how these can support the overall program
goals and drive for results. The CVP also ensures
appropriate branding of a program, participating
development partners, and the World Bank.


STRATEGIC FUNDRAISING


The Strategic External Funds Framework (SEFF)
exercise was launched in FY2021 to support Bank
Management in furthering the evolution to a more
strategy-driven approach to fundraising. The
exercise consolidated progress made in the shift
to a streamlined Umbrella 2.0 trust fund portfolio
architecture and allowed for Management to review
fundraising plans and ensure their alignment with
priorities. Based on the plans laid out in the SEFF, 90
percent of trust fund fundraising will be channeled
through the proposed 72 Umbrella 2.0 Programs, a
higher share than previously expected at this early
stage in the reform implementation. [2]



The progress made on the Umbrella 2.0 Program
rollout and enhanced management oversight of
fundraising have made it possible for the Bank to

avoid a moratorium on donor outreach for trust

fund contributions during an IDA replenishment
year, as had been the case in the past. This new
Responsible Fundraising approach has ensured
that IDA20 replenishment remains the top priority
in 2021, supplemented by strategic trust fund
fundraising plans complementary to and supportive
of IDA and IBRD. Moving forward, the streamlined
SEFF will be an annual management exercise
for reviewing and updating strategic priorities for

**** fundraising and authorizing changes in the trust fund

portfolio architecture.


In parallel with the World Bank’s transition to
Umbrella 2.0 Programs, IFC has undertaken a
similar exercise designed to consolidate fundraising
in trust funds that can house multiple projects
and programs in a single, efficient administrative
structure. The Facility for Investment Climate
Advisory Services (FIAS), one of the World Bank
Group’s oldest and largest multi-donor trust funds,
is one of the key vehicles for IFC’s approach. FIAS
supports IFC Advisory services that foster inclusive
private sector growth in client countries, with a
focus on IDA, fragile states, and Africa.


During the FY2017–21 FIAS strategy cycle, 16 donor
countries and organizations supported FIAS-backed
IFC teams in helping to bring about 200 reforms
that are making it easier to invest, start, and grow
businesses in developing countries. More than half
of these reforms took place in IDA countries, and
about one-fourth were in FCV-affected situations.
The strong working-level ties that IFC teams have
developed with their clients paid dividends as the
COVID-19 crisis unfolded and projects in the FIAS
portfolio pivoted to meet urgent client demand.

2 In some limited circumstances, the Bank may establish stand-alone trust funds (outside of umbrella programs), for example, to
co-finance an IBRD or IDA project, or when it would not be possible or practical to channel donor resources in an umbrella as
determined by Management. See, for example, the Cambodia Health Equity and Quality Improvement Program on page 37.

in international development networks, data and
research, and its ability to work across sectors and to
design and apply innovative financial instruments. [3]


As the following examples illustrate, the World Bank
Group has a unique ability to convene partners,
draw upon its deep professional expertise and
knowledge as a thought leader, provide trusted
sources of development data and analysis, facilitate
consensus on approaches to key development
issues, and then activate these approaches in the
Bank Group’s country operations. These abilities
enable the Bank Group to use trust funds for the
purpose of partnership. See more information about
these activities and their contributing development
partners in the accompanying [2021 Yearbook of](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/trust-fund-annual-report-2021)

[Trust-funded Results.](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/trust-fund-annual-report-2021)


CONVENING MULTIPLE ACTORS


The World Bank Group is able to convene a broad
range of actors around an agenda. For example,
under the FoodSystems2030 Umbrella 2.0 Program,
the World Bank is bringing together stakeholders—
from farmers to government policy makers—to
repurpose agricultural policies to make food systems
more resilient, sustainable, and fit-for-purpose from
the point of view of people, the economy, and the
planet. What started as a policy note to COP24 in

2018 became a critical contribution to the UN Food

System Summit in September 2021 and a key lever
for mobilizing action under the cross-cutting theme

on Nature at COP26 in 2021.


ENGAGING AS A PROGRAM PARTNER


Once programs have been established, the World
Bank Group actively engages as a partner, by
facilitating agreements on approaches to key
development issues, and then operationalizing these
approaches in the Bank Group’s country operations.


Since the formulation of its first strategy for working
with the European Union (EU) in 2010, the World
Bank has been a critical partner of the EU in Europe



and Central Asia (ECA), by contributing its technical
expertise, global experience, and ability to structure
and deliver large-scale operations. The new
Strategic European Partnerships Umbrella 2.0
Program (STEP-UP) is the most recent iteration of
this partnership, focusing on a) harnessing relevant
knowledge and expertise, b) ensuring shared policy
priorities for institutional strengthening, and c)
leveraging areas of complementarity between EU
and Bank priorities.


Since 2019, the World Bank has been convening
partners around Gov-Tech, a whole-of-government
approach to public sector modernization that
promotes simple, efficient, and transparent
government with the citizen at the center of
reforms. The GovTech approach is at the forefront
of supporting countries to digitally transform their
governments to boost their effectiveness and
improve service delivery using technologies already

available and accessible in most countries. The

GovTech Global Partnership has subsequently
supported readiness assessments and new
GovTech strategies for digital public service delivery
in a range of countries.


##### **1.5 BRINGING THE BEST** **OF WBG TO TRUST FUND** **PARTNERSHIPS**

The World Bank Group contributes to trust-funded
programs, such as Umbrella 2.0 Programs, through
the partnership elements inherent in them. When
the Bank Group engages as one of the partners in
a trust-funded program, it is not simply a contractor
for hire that provides services for the contributing
donors. Rather, it brings all its institutional capacities
to bear to achieve shared objectives more efficiently
than one partner could achieve by itself.


From the international coalition of development
partners and clients that constitute the World
Bank Group to engagement with UN agencies,
international NGOs, foundations, and civil society
to an increasing focus on leveraging private
capital—the World Bank Group has long recognized
the transformative power of partnership where
new ideas, perspectives, and experiences are
combined with the necessary financial resources.
Partnerships require more than financial resources
to be successful; they need buy-in to legitimize the
collaboration and advocacy that can extend their
reach beyond the immediate partners.



Trust funds as a partnering mechanism have been
in place for decades and have been instrumental
in building upon the expertise and resources of
multiple development partners and the World Bank
Group. They are the most commonly used vehicle
for funding partnerships in which the Bank Group,
development partners, and other stakeholders work
together to tackle a specific development issue or
find new ways to approach problems at the global,
regional, or country level (Box 1.3). Umbrella 2.0
Programs are now becoming the primary way to
partner with the World Bank through trust funds.


A 2020 evaluation by the Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) found that trust funds and FIFs provide
important convening opportunities for the World
Bank Group to bring together relevant actors to
address global, regional, and local development
challenges. This is because trust funds and FIFs,
as financial vehicles, are the essential components
around which global partnership programs and
other global initiatives are constructed and operate.
The evaluation also found that the Bank Group both
leads and supports convening in different instances.
The leaders of partner organizations view the Bank
Group’s comparative advantages in convening as
its global reach, country presence, central place

18 WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021 Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships 19


In 2017, the World Bank played an essential role as a
facilitator, thought leader, and convener of a broad
group of development partners, UN agencies, and
the private sector to create a shared vision for “good”
ID systems in the Principles of Identification for
Sustainable Development. Since then, through the
Identification for Development (ID4D) Program,
the Bank has deeply infused these principles into its
support for civil registration and ID systems globally,
including analytical work, technical assistance, and
over $1.5 billion in World Bank financing. Three years
later, the same group of stakeholders came together
to revisit the Principles to ensure that they continue
to reflect new realities and good practices.


IFC’s Global Cities Platform connects

municipalities, regional governments, and the
private sector around complex cities transformation
initiatives and underlying development challenges.
The platform has enabled IFC to refocus its work
with three of Colombia’s largest cities during the
COVID-19 pandemic. It pivoted from catalyzing

investments in sustainable urban infrastructure to

helping the public sector balance the need to protect
citizens and slow the spread of the virus with a
desire to reopen economies. In 2020, IFC supported
the city of Bogota to define and collect data on the
impact of the quarantine on women, which will be
used to inform a data-driven gender-sensitive policy
response. IFC is also preparing Advisory packages
covering smart cities, urban mobility, waste and

water solutions, and environmental and social

policies, tailored to the needs of each city.


ADVANCING CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES


The World Bank Group works through trust-funded
partnerships to advance cross-cutting issues
inherent in the global consensus underlying the
SDGs—in these cases, advancing gender equality.


Several years ago, the Public-Private Infrastructure
Facility (PPIAF) and IFC began a modest initiative
to advance gender equality in public-private
partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure in the light of
the World Bank’s 2015–23 Gender Strategy. This
investigation of gender equity considerations within
PPPs culminated in the publication of a primer on
Gender Equality, Infrastructure and PPPs in May



2019. Today, the primer is playing a key role in moving
PPP practitioners in development banks and client
countries toward a more systematic integration of
gender considerations in PPP projects.


To share and build greater knowledge among
governments, academia, industry, and civil society
on actions that could enhance gender equality
in oil, gas and mining, the Extractives Global
Programmatic Support Program (EGPS) and
the Inter-American Development Bank jointly
organized the Second Gender Oil, Gas and Mining
Conference, held virtually in March 2021. The World
Bank contributed its deep professional expertise and
knowledge to the conference to assist participants
in bringing about improvements in all people’s lives
working in the sector.

![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-19-2.png)



RALLYING IN-COUNTRY ACTORS


The World Bank Group can also convene countrylevel partners to enable trust funding. The World
Bank set up and activated the Tunisia Economic

Resilience and Inclusion (TERI) Umbrella 2.0

Program in record time in March 2021 in response
to an urgent request from the Tunisian government
to help put in place an end-to-end management
and information system before the first COVID-9
vaccines arrived in the country. The Bank mobilized
relevant funds in a very short time period through
an initial contribution by the United Kingdom, which
enabled the Bank to respond to this request in a
challenging and dynamic context.



![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-19-1.png)



PROVIDING GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS


The World Bank is one of the main and most trusted

sources of national sustainability data and analysis. It
fosters collaboration and partnerships by providing
global public goods in the form of analytical toolkits
and open-source data portals.



Since 2016, the Global Procurement Partnership
(GPP) has supported innovative activities for
procurement reforms at the global and country
levels, including the Methodology for Assessing
Procurement Systems (MAPS). This universal
diagnostic tool for public procurement systems
assesses the accountability, integrity, and
transparency of the public procurement systems
of countries or jurisdictions, including the legal,
regulatory, and institutional frameworks and market
practices. The partnership has subsequently funded
the implementation of 15 MAPS assessments across
five regions, including eight IDA countries and five
FCV-affected countries, and supported follow-up
action plans and reforms in some of these countries.


In early 2019, the Financial Sector Reform and
Strengthening Initiative (FIRST), the Global
Program on Sustainability, and several other World
Bank trust funds joined forces to improve the
quality of publicly available environmental, social
and governance (ESG) data. The Sovereign ESG
Data Portal helps investors make more informed
decisions and direct their capital to the countries,
companies and projects where it is needed to meet
the SDGs and the Paris Climate Accord targets.
Launched in October 2019, the portal is a free,
open, and easy-to-use online platform that provides
users with sovereign-level ESG data, for all World
Bank countries, so that investors can better engage
sovereign issuers on ESG criteria and policies.

## T he World Bank Group has mounted the fastest and largest crisis response

in its history to help developing countries
respond and recover from the COVID-19

crisis. This response, which also applies to
trust funds and FIFs, is taking place across
three stages: relief, restructuring, and
resilient recovery.


The World Bank Group has made available around
$157 billion from April 2020 through June 2021,
including from IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA, trust funds,
and portfolio allocations. The response recognizes
that COVID-19 is not only a health crisis, but also
a wide-ranging socio-economic crisis that involves
saving lives, protecting poor and vulnerable people,
ensuring sustainable business growth and job
creation, and strengthening policies, institutions,

and investments (Box 2.1).


World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs are
all contributing to the COVID-19 response
in accordance with their particular niches.



Many development partners are making new

contributions to trust funds and FIFs for these

purposes, including channeling resources in their
Donor Balance Accounts held by the Bank Group. [4]

##### **2.1 TRUST FUND AND FIF** **CONTRIBUTIONS**


IBRD/IDA TRUST FUNDS


By the end of FY2021, IBRD/IDA trust funds had
contributed, in whole or in part, $1.13 billion to 248
World Bank operations that are helping countries
respond directly to the COVID-19 crisis. About 93
percent of commitments ($1.06 billion) has been in
the form of trust-funded RE grants and 7 percent
of commitments ($77 million) have been in the

form of trust-funded BE grants. About 41 percent of
commitments ($481 million) were disbursed by June
30, 2021. This represents more than 10 percent of
all trust fund disbursements during the 15 months
between April 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021.

4 Donor Balance Account (DBAs) are administrative accounts that the Bank establishes on behalf of an individual donor agency to
temporarily hold funds until such time as they are returned to the donor agency, transferred to another trust fund, or used for purposes
as agreed with the donor agency. DBAs are established by donor agency, not by donor country.

Of the 248 operations, 135 are lending projects,
105 are ASA, and 8 are research and knowledge
activities. The 135 lending projects were supported
by 137 trust funds for BE activities, 65 co-financing

trust funds for RE activities, and 26 stand-alone trust

funds for RE activities. The 105 ASA were supported
by 124 trust funds for BE activities and the 8 research
and knowledge products were supported by 9 trustfunds for BE activities (Figure 2.1).


As shown in Figure 2.2, the number of new trustfunded BE grant commitments for the COVID-19
response accelerated from five commitments in the
third quarter of FY2020 (January to March 2020) to
43 commitments in the fourth quarter (April to June
2020), and 82 commitments in the first quarter of
FY2021 (July to September 2020). The number of
new trust-funded RE grant commitments peaked
one quarter later at 26 grants during the second
quarter of FY2021 (October to December 2020).

Trust fund commitment amounts for both BE and

RE activities peaked during the first quarter of
FY2021, with BE grants at $27.4 million and RE
grants at $297 million (Figure 2.3).



IBRD/IDA trust funds are especially critical for

countries that do not have access to IBRD/IDA

financing. These include countries in arrears

(Zimbabwe and Sudan), [5] and non-members (West

Bank and Gaza). Syrian refugees in Lebanon and
Jordan, and Venezuelan refugees in Ecuador are
other special cases where trust funds can provide

vital resources because their access to IBRD or IDA

resources is constrained. The COVID-19 pandemic
has also exacerbated risks in FCV-affected
countries, such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Five of the
top 10 countries receiving trust fund support for
COVID-19-related activities are affected by FCV and
collectively accounted for 54 percent of total trust
fund commitments for COVID-19 response.


For example, the Afghanistan Reconstruction
Trust Fund (ARTF) approved five RE grants totaling
$470 million during FY2021, alongside IDA financing
of $420 million, to help the country respond to the
COVID-19 crisis. This included a development policy
grant to strengthen the policy for relief and recovery
and four investment projects that aimed to support
critical food supply chains, provide emergency
support to households, improve access to and
quality of water supplies, and strengthen national
systems for public health preparedness.

Overall, the umbrella framework has facilitated a

more rapid response than might otherwise have
been the case. Some programs have streamlined
grant-making processes to make crisis recovery
funds available to implementing partners as quickly
as possible. They have also pivoted existing grants

to address clients’ most immediate needs. These

adjustments have enabled programs to free up
resources to support their COVID-19 responses and
deliver on the most pressing priorities.


For example, the Global Facility for Disaster
Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) has adapted
existing engagements to help countries manage
the pandemic. It is supporting the development
of emergency preparedness plans and response
protocols, identifying and repurposing public
facilities, and scaling approaches that link disaster
risk management preparedness and response
systems to health emergencies. Going forward,
GFDRR will work with partners to support

communities and countries to meet the dual

challenge of managing natural hazard risks, while
mobilizing the disaster risk management community
to address the impacts of the pandemic.


The Human Rights, Inclusion and Empowerment
(HRIE) program has also adjusted grant
implementation to make up for cancelled or
postponed on-the-ground activities, such as



primary data collection, engagement with local
governments and CSOs, and field visits to supervise
implementation. Working with governments
and CSOs, teams have shifted gears to continue
reaching out to marginalized populations. An
e-learning program was developed in lieu of inperson training, enabling teams to reach much
broader audiences than previously anticipated.


The Debt Management Facility (DMF) has
also changed its way of doing business to meet
client country needs. Instead of traveling to client
countries to provide technical assistance, it has
adapted to remote delivery. It has also prioritized the
development of new Massive Online Open Courses
(MOOCs) offering self-paced learning opportunities,
as well as adapting other training and learning
opportunities to a virtual format.


From a thematic perspective, five World Bank
Global Practices collectively account for 87 percent
of the IBRD/IDA trust fund response to COVID-19,
starting with the Health, Nutrition and Population
Global Practice at 28 percent (Figure 2.5). These
show that the Bank’s COVID-19 response addresses
not just the health crisis, but also the wider socio
economic crisis.



The Jordan Inclusive Growth and Economic

Opportunities MDTF provided $24.17 million
alongside $350 million of IBRD financing for
the Jordan Emergency Cash Transfer COVID-19
Response Project, which was approved in June
2020. Like other small, open economies with strong
links to global markets, Jordan’s real GDP contracted
by 1.6 percent in 2020 due to profound impacts on
key sectors of the economy, such as services, travel
receipts, and tourism. Economic contraction and
job loss have hit women and youth especially hard.
The project is providing temporary cash transfers to
270,000 poor and vulnerable households adversely
affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.


Low-income countries have received 62 percent

of total COVID-19-related trust fund commitments

and lower middle-income countries have received

25 percent. The World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) initiated a Debt Service
Suspension Initiative (DSSI) allowing participating
countries to temporarily suspend debt-service
payments to their official creditors. Since its launch
on May 1, 2020, the initiative has delivered more

than $5 billion in relief to more than 40 countries

who chose to participate in it, out of the 73 eligible



countries. [6] About 64 percent of total COVID-19related trust fund commitments have gone to
participating DSSI countries, and another 9 percent
to non-participating eligible countries.


The transition of the IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio

toward better focused, more consolidated Umbrella

2.0 Programs is also showing results through the
World Bank Group’s crisis response. A total of 27
Umbrella Programs have responded to COVID-19
with new grant-level commitments, collectively
representing 57 percent of the total trust fund
response of $1.13 billion as of end of FY2021.


The remainder of the response has come in part
from three FIF-supported programs (28 percent) for
which the World Bank is one of the implementing
entities—the Global Partnership for Education, the
Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, and the
Global Concessional Financing Facility—and from
some other large trust-funded programs (14 percent)
like the West Bank and Gaza MDTF. The top seven
programs, led by the Afghanistan Reconstruction
Trust Fund, have accounted for 84 percent of
the grant commitments to COVID-19-related
activities (Figure 2.4).

Until it closed in April 2021, PEF was a fastdisbursing financing mechanism to provide surge
funding to IDA-eligible countries in the case of major
multi-country disease outbreaks like COVID-19.
Its Cash Window, which has been supported by

traditional donor contributions into a trust fund,

had paid out $61.4 million to support the frontline response to Ebola in the Democratic Republic
of Congo in 2018 and 2019. On March 31, 2020,
conditions for a payout from the PEF Insurance
Window were met, releasing the maximum
coverage of $195.84 million to support the COVID-19
pandemic response in IDA countries. The PEF
Steering Body allocated the whole amount to 64 of
the world’s poorest countries with reported cases
of COVID-19, with special attention given to areas
with the most vulnerable populations, especially in
FCV-affected countries. By September 30, 2020,
the entire insurance payout had been transferred to
support COVID-19 responses, with the World Bank
serving as one of the main implementing entities for

PEF grants.


Other FIF-supported programs in agriculture,

education, the environment, and infrastructure

have also addressed some of the immediate socioeconomic effects of the crisis. They have been fully
engaged in addressing the question of how the
world can end the pandemic and emerge stronger,
more united, more equitable, and more prepared for
future known threats. (Section 3.3.)



largest portfolio of vaccines against COVID-19,
it has also awarded forgivable loans to expand
global manufacturing capacity and established
a global network of laboratories to standardize

vaccine assessment.


Established in 2006, IFFIm issues Vaccine Bonds

in capital markets, backed by binding pledges from
donor countries, which provide immediate funding
for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to purchase and
distribute vaccines. With the World Bank serving
as Treasury Manager, IFFIm has played a critical
role in frontloading donor pledges to support the
international community’s response to COVID-19
pandemic. During 2020, IFFIm provided $272
million to Gavi for use by CEPI to develop COVID-19
vaccines. Then in January 2021, IFFIm provided a

first tranche of $400 million to Gavi for COVAX AMC

to fund the purchase of vaccines for 92 of the world’s
poorest countries, and an additional $380 million for

COVAX AMC as of June 30, 2021. The Vaccine Bonds

issued by IFFIm to support these disbursements
have included the first-ever Norwegian Kronerdenominated bonds in July 2020 and the second
largest issuance of $750 million in April 2021.


Established in 2002, the Global Fund also

responded quickly and decisively to the COVID-19
crisis, by approving up to $1 billion in April 2020
to help countries respond to the pandemic; adapt
their HIV, TB and malaria programs; and reinforce
their already overstretched health systems.
Through its COVID-19 Response Mechanism,
the Global Fund has become the primary grant
support to low- and middle-income counties for
obtaining COVID-19 tests, treatments, and personal
protective equipment. The Global Fund is also a
founding partner of the Access to COVID-19 Tools

Accelerator (ACT-Accelerator) and co-leads two

of the ACT-Accelerator’s four components: the
Diagnostics Pillar and Health Systems Connector.
This global collaboration of leading public health
agencies is working with governments, civil society
and industry to accelerate the development and
equitable distribution of tests, treatments, and
vaccines and to strengthen health systems.



IFC TRUST FUNDS


The private sector’s role in development has
never been more important than it is now, as the

world works to recover from the COVID-19 crisis.

Governments around the world have reallocated

resources to combat the spread of COVID-19,
making limited public resources scarcer and
highlighting the importance of catalyzing private

sector investments.


IFC is helping countries weather the devastating
economic impacts of COVID-19 and build a more

sustainable, inclusive, and resilient future with the

support of the private sector. With insolvencies
looming across the developing world, IFC is working
to preserve the private sector, rebuild economies,
and work upstream to create projects that will
attract investment back into developing countries.
IFC’s goal is also to help restructure and recapitalize
viable financial institutions and companies on their
path to recovery, as well as alleviate bottlenecks in
critical supply sectors such as health care.


For example, IFC has launched a $4 billion Global
Health Platform aimed at boosting the production
and supply of critical COVID-19 health care products
in developing countries. The initiative, supported by
development partners, is focusing on manufacturing
products, such as personal protective equipment,
ventilators and other medical equipment, COVID-19
test kits, therapeutic drugs, and vaccines.


Strong emphasis is being placed on supporting
clients operating in low-income and FCV-affected
countries. To attract foreign direct investment
into these more challenging locations, IFC is also
leveraging concessional financing from trust funds.


As IFC works to help countries build a resilient
recovery, trust funds will be important contributors.
IFC aims to accelerate the expansion of upstream
activities with the goal of building back better and
delivering interventions that meet the short-term
needs but also maintain a line of sight on longerterm development challenges. Development
partner support through trust funds will be needed
to develop projects quickly, build capacity, and
support delivery, as well as to mitigate risks and
encourage the private sector to invest.



IFC is also working with the World Bank to ensure
that countries have policies and regulations in place
to resolve distressed assets, and that companies’
underlying operations are restructured to be viable
to support growth and sustain employment.


IFC has adapted its delivery modes in response to
COVID-19. It has overcome travel restrictions by
moving to virtual outreach and delivery platforms,
including piloting innovative approaches such as
virtual reality assessments. The focus on virtual
and remote consultation has spurred clients to
adopt digital solutions that will facilitate future

engagement.


FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY FUNDS


The global initiatives supported by FIFs have
provided much needed leadership and support
in providing immediate relief to the COVID-19
pandemic. Four health-related FIFs have played
leading roles in COVID-19 vaccine research and
development, preparedness and response: the
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations
(CEPI), International Finance Facility for
Immunisation (IFFIm), the Global Fund to Fight

AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), and

the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF).

In addition, the Advanced Market Commitment

(AMC) for Pneumococcal Vaccines has served as

a model for establishing the COVID-19 Vaccines
Global Access (COVAX) AMC, which is creating
market-based incentives to support more equitable,

world-wide access to COVID vaccines.


Established in 2018, CEPI was one of the first

organizations to start investing in the development

of COVID-19 vaccines. Prior to the COVID-19

pandemic, CEPI had allocated over $140 million to
develop vaccines against MERS, a virus related to
SARS-CoV-2. During 2020, CEPI was able to pivot
most of its MERS and platform technology partners
to work on COVID-19 and rapidly built up a portfolio
of 11 vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. By the end of year,
two of these vaccines had demonstrated high
efficacy in preventing severe COVID-19 disease
and had received emergency use authorizations,
enabling roll out of vaccine doses in early 2021.
Not only has CEPI invested in one of the world’s



28 WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021 Chapter 2. Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis 29


and safety net responses to the pandemic. This call
focused on systems to help households cope with
income and job loss, ensure continued access to
social and human capital services, and address
the disproportionate socio-economic impact of the
virus on women and girls.


PROBLUE has prioritized activities supporting
fishing communities that have been adversely
impacted by the pandemic, as well as new activities

around water and sanitation issues in the fisheries

value chain.


The Extractives Global Programmatic Support
(EGPS) Umbrella Program has established a $5.2
million emergency response facility to provide
short-term assistance to a range of international,
regional, and local organizations providing
relief to artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM)
communities. The COVID-19 pandemic threatened
to reverse the enormous progress that ASM

communities have made to formalize the sector.

Similar to informal workers worldwide, ASM

communities are disproportionally vulnerable to the
COVID-19 crisis due to poor health care, precarious
working conditions, high incidence of respiratory
diseases, and exposure of vulnerable groups in an
environment of limited government oversight.


##### **2.2 STORIES FROM THE FIELD**

Trust-funded programs are contributing to the World
Bank Group’s COVID-19 response by supporting
efforts to save lives, protect poor and vulnerable
people, ensure sustainable business growth and job
creation, and strengthen policies, institutions, and
investments. Many of these activities are detailed in

the [2021 Yearbook of Trust-funded Results.](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/trust-fund-annual-report-2021)


SAVING LIVES


The Global Financing Facility (GFF) and the
Health Emergency Preparedness and Response
Fund (HEPR) are leading the IBRD/IDA trust funds’
contribution to mitigating COVID-19 transmission,
delivering health services, ensuring that vulnerable

households have access to medical care, and

building resilience for future pandemics. The
Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) was
also an important contributor until its closure in
April 2021 (Figure 2.4).


The GFF has played a complementary role to
the World Bank’s efforts to finance the purchase
and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, tests, and

treatments. Its COVID-19 Essential Health Services

grants have enabled partner countries to prioritize
and strengthen primary care and community-based
services, capacities, and the health workforce that
are critical for the equitable and effective delivery of

both COVID-19 tools and essential health services.

The GFF is helping to ensure that as countries
recover and build their next generation health
systems, they prioritize access to quality, affordable
care for women, children, and adolescents.


The World Bank set up the HEPR Umbrella Program
in 2020 to complement regular IBRD/IDA resources.
It provides upstream and catalytic funding to
help countries prepare for and rapidly respond to
emerging health emergencies, even when they occur
outside their borders. By the end of FY2021, HEPR

had secured over $175 million in donor contributions,

and allocated nearly $117 million to 24 countries and
regional efforts, with 59 percent of grant allocations
to address the COVID-19 pandemic and 41 percent
to prepare better for future health emergencies.



![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-24-1.png)

Many of these grants have been processed as cofinancing to new or existing World Bank projects
that focus on health emergency preparedness and
the client countries’ COVID-19 responses.


The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted
the critical need for electricity to save lives. The
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program
(ESMAP) has developed a strong collaboration with

the World Bank’s Health Global Practice and its

global partners to rapidly deliver a climate-informed
COVID-19 response. It is focusing on electrification
of health facilities with renewable energy and
sustainable operational models and on deployment

of reliable and climate-smart cold chains to deliver

vaccines. In Haiti, for example, ESMAP is supporting
efforts to install solar hybrid electricity systems
for prioritized health care and water facilities.
Approximately 1 million people are expected to gain
improved access to health services and clean water

as a result.


PROTECTING THE POOR AND

MOST VULNERABLE


Trust funds are also supporting World Bank Group’s
efforts to protect incomes and food supplies for
the most vulnerable, as well as employment for
poorer households, informal businesses, and
microenterprises impacted by the pandemic.
Leading the trust fund contribution to mitigating
both the immediate and long-term disruptions to
education is the Global Partnership for Education
(GPE), a FIF for which the World Bank is an

implementing entity. This includes more than $175
million in World Bank-supervised RE grants to help
children in recipient countries to continue to access
learning opportunities, with a focus on girls and
poor children, who have been the hardest hit by

school closures.


The Rapid Social Response–Adaptive and
Dynamic Social Protection (RSR–ADSP) Umbrella
Program issued its latest call for grant proposals
in early FY2021 to address gender-specific and
Orlando Barría / World Bank differentiated concerns as part of social protection

30 WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021 Chapter 2. Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis 31


SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE

BUSINESS GROWTH AND JOBS


World Bank Group trust funds are providing policy
and financial assistance to governments, businesses,
and financial institutions to help companies,
especially small and medium-enterprises (SMEs),
preserve jobs, weather the crisis, and return
to growth.


The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor
(CGAP) has provided guidance to microfinance
institutions on navigating the COVID-19 crisis and
improving their resilience to future shocks, and to
governments on improving government-to-person
payment (G2P) systems. The World Bank and CGAP
have helped accelerate policy reforms in countries
that had not yet invested in digital systems and
were struggling to distribute relief payments. CGAP
support to Ecuador, Indonesia, Lebanon, Pakistan,
the Philippines, Sudan, and Zambia, among others,
has resulted in reforms being implemented in a few
months that would normally take years.



COVID-19 was impacting women differently than
men. In response, the SheWorks companies came
together for a series of webinars to share lessons
learned about how to support employees, especially
women, during the pandemic. They reported that the
family-friendly policy frameworks, like flex-work and
remote working that had been put in place due to
SheWorks, enabled them to seamlessly transition to
work from home during lock downs. This COVID-19
study has led to two new IFC projects in Sri Lanka
focusing on SME capacity building and COVID-19
impacts on employment.



![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-25-1.png)



have the most significant impact on health. Each
of its the major work streams, but particularly
Environmental Health, Air Quality Management,
and Circular Economy, will have strong links to the
COVID-19 pandemic in terms of analytical work,
addressing connections between air pollution and

COVID-19 outcomes.


PROBLUE is also contributing to a clean recovery
through its focus on marine pollution prevention,
for example, by assessing the impacts of singleuse plastics use in health care facilities and by
developing health care waste management plans in
cities along rivers and in coastal areas.


STRENGTHENING POLICIES,
INSTITUTIONS, AND INVESTMENTS


Trust-funded activities are also helping countries
prepare for a resilient recovery, with an emphasis on
improving governance and institutions. The Global
Tax Program (GTP) Umbrella Program responded to
the COVID-19 crisis by providing countries with justin-time fiscal policy advice on developing effective,
efficient, and balanced fiscal policy responses.
This has included macro-fiscal policy, domestic
resource mobilization, expenditure policy, and fiscal
risk management, plus important cross-cutting
themes, such as poverty and distributional impact,
transparency, and accountability. An additional
$5.4 million in donor contributions is supporting
GTP efforts on long-term fiscal sustainability

and resilience.


In 2020, IFC signed its first national-level agreement

with the Federal Government of Somalia to

provide a road map for the development of the of
the nascent private sector. It was part of ongoing
legal and regulatory Advisory work supported by
two Somalia Private Sector Development trust
funds. IFC collaborated with partners to conduct
a survey of businesses across the country to help
the government assess the impact of COVID-19.
Although the initial impact was devastating—90
percent of firms experienced decreased liquidity
and cash flow—the survey found that companies
were optimistic for the future. IFC’s work in Somalia



aims to build on this optimism, and ensure that,
moving forward, companies have the institutional
framework to help support them to fully recover and
operate their businesses sustainably.

![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-25-0.png)


To help governments navigate the impacts of
COVID-19 on their PPPs for infrastructure projects,
the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory
Facility (PPIAF) and the World Bank have launched
a COVID-19 PPP Rapid Response Program. It
conducts rapid assessments of countries’ portfolios
to identify fiscal, financial, and social risks; estimate
their costs; and inform decision-makers on options
and actions. The program has brought global
financial, fiscal, technical, and legal expertise to
eight countries and one regional engagement
during its first year of operation, including Peru and
the Philippines.

Since 2017, IFC’s SheWorks Sri Lanka Partnership,
supported by the DFAT-IFC Global Advisory
Services Trust Fund, has worked with 15 leading
employers across different industries to help identify
and implement gender-smart business solutions
to boost women’s participation and business
productivity. Twelve of these companies participated
in a 2020 IFC survey in Sri Lanka that demonstrated



The pandemic has also highlighted the critical
need for water to not only prevent the spread

of the disease, but also to revitalize economies,

employment opportunities, health outcomes, and
the environment. The Global Water Security and
Sanitation Program (GWSP) has utilized the
umbrella approach to quickly provide resources
across its various business lines to tackle emerging
needs, while also preserving long-term engagements
on the ground. Sustaining the gains of the past and
putting countries back on track to achieve SDG 6
(clean water and sanitation) are fundamental to a

resilient and sustainable recovery and will remain a
focus for GWSP in the medium to long term.


As governments turn their attention to economic
recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, there are
new opportunities to embrace green, resilient,
and inclusive recovery programs to achieve more
growth with lower pollution. PROCLEAN activities
will help tackle the environmental problems that





32 WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021 Chapter 2. Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis 33


![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-26-full.png)
## T he World Bank Group’s COVID-19 crisis response has provided an opportunity

to support a strong, durable recovery that
tackles rising poverty and deepening
inequality while addressing the longerterm challenge of climate change.


The Bank Group’s green, resilient, and inclusive
development approach, or GRID, calls for scaling up
investments in all forms of capital—human, physical,
natural, and social—to drive growth, create jobs,
and contribute to a better future for all, especially
vulnerable, low-income populations. Integrated,
longer-horizon GRID strategies can repair the
structural damage caused by COVID-19 and
accelerate climate action while restoring momentum
on poverty reduction and shared prosperity.


The World Bank Group is well positioned to help
countries with the challenges ahead through
its convening power, global reach, and capacity

to mobilize finance, technical assistance, and

knowledge for both the public and private sectors
and in cooperation with its development partners.
This clear line of sight forward points to progress
already being made to strengthen resilience across
systems and society.



Looking back over the last five years, trust funds
and FIFs have supported World Bank Group
public and private sector efforts in health, climate
action, gender, social protection and jobs, and debt
management—all essential building blocks for
greater resilience and key development priorities
of client countries. Not only do these themes align
with the GRID approach, but they also reveal the
diversity and strategic value of trust-funded activities
already underway.


As shown in Table 3.1, social protection and jobs has
received more than 42 percent of IBRD/IDA trust
fund support to these five themes during the last five
years, followed by health (28 percent) and climate
action (24 percent). About 68 percent of FIF support
has been for health and 31 percent for climate
action. Together with IFC’s ongoing work with the
private sector, this represents a strong foundation
for greater resilience now and into the future.


The following activities, which are expanded in the

[2021 Yearbook of Trust-funded Results, demonstrate](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/trust-fund-annual-report-2021)

how World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs
advance countries’ development priorities and help
build greater resilience.

### **3.1 WORLD BANK TRUST FUNDS** **HEALTH**



Ensuring that every man, woman, and child has
access to health care is fundamental to ending
poverty and building robust economies. The
pandemic has disrupted delivery of essential health
services, particularly in the poorest nations with the
most fragile health systems, threatening to reverse
years of hard-won gains in health and human capital

outcomes. Now more than ever there is a need to

strengthen national health systems’ preparedness
and capacities and ensure continuity of essential

health services.


In addition to health interventions related to

COVID-19 (Section 2.2), ongoing health sector

investments and research within the World Bank

are focused on building resilient health systems,
with trust funds playing an integral role.


For example, the Global Financing Facility for

Women, Children and Adolescents (GFF) is

supporting the World Bank’s Liberia Health System
Strengthening Project to improve service delivery

![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-27-4.png)

and health outcomes for women and children.

This work had contributed to 24 percent more
assisted deliveries and 20 percent more children
being immunized in six at-risk counties, but these
gains were jeopardized when COVID-19 disrupted
delivery of essential services. The GFF quickly
adapted its grant funding to focus on strengthening



community health channels and addressing low
service demand. Funding helped modify the delivery

of routine health services for COVID-19, increase the

capacity of frontline health care workers, and adapt
existing programming to address emergency needs.


The GFF has also worked alongside the World Bank
and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund
(ARTF) on the Sehatmandi Project to improve
the delivery and quality of health, nutrition, and
family planning services in 34 provinces across
Afghanistan. By the end of FY2021, a first-ever
resource mapping and expenditure tracking exercise
had helped to assess the impact of investments on
the quality of basic health services.


A new performance-based system was also

The volume of services delivered under the project
increased for 10 out of 11 payment indicators. For

##### **CAMBODIA: PRO-POOR** **APPROACH TO QUALITY** **HEALTH SERVICES**

The Cambodia Health Equity and Quality
Improvement Program (H-EQIP) MDTF supports
a program of the same name that is helping the
Cambodian government improve nationwide access
to better quality, affordable health services. Despite
dramatic reductions in poverty and improved health
outcomes (especially in maternal and child health),
socio-economic and rural-urban health inequalities
persist in Cambodia. About one quarter of the
population remains vulnerable to small economic
shocks, and out-of-pocket expenditures on health
care are around 60 percent—one of the highest

rates in the world.


To improve service quality and help poor households
overcome the cost barrier, [H-EQIP helped launch](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2019/09/12/service-delivery-grants-motivates-health-providers-perform-better)
[service delivery grants, which are regular payments](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2019/09/12/service-delivery-grants-motivates-health-providers-perform-better)
to health facilities based on performance, and
health equity funds (HEFs), which purchase health
services on behalf of registered households so that
they can access care free of charge.



![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-27-7.png)





An important moment for H-EQIP came in 2020
when its Contingent Emergency Response
Component (CERC) was activated. This enabled

immediate mobilization of $14 million for Cambodia’s

COVID-19 response without interrupting continuity
in the delivery of core health services.

### **CLIMATE ACTION**



The threat of climate change remains critical for
countries, forcing people to evacuate homes, grapple
with food insecurity, or the impacts of deforestation
and biodiversity loss, even as they also deal with
the health and economic impacts of the pandemic.
Left unchecked, climate change will push 132 million
people into poverty over the next 10 years, undoing
hard-won development gains.


The World Bank Group is the largest multilateral
provider of climate finance for developing countries,
and it is focused on increasing climate ambition
and action around the world. Ongoing trustfunded activities are not only helping countries
cope with climate vulnerabilities that threaten their
ongoing development, but also helping them stay
competitive as the global economy moves toward a

net-zero future.


For example, the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection
Program (SASSP) is supporting adaptive social
protection programs in six Sahelian countries. The

![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-28-3.png)

combination of cash transfers and assistance is

helping poor and vulnerable households become
more resilient to shocks and stresses, particularly
the impacts of climate change. The program has
helped pilot an early drought response mechanism
that uses satellite data to trigger rapid-response

cash transfers to at-risk households in Mauritania

and Niger.


The Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance

Facility (SEADRIF) is a first-of-its-kind facility in
Asia that leverages financial markets to provide

![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-28-5.png)

member countries with technical and financial

solutions for better protection against disaster



shocks in the face of climate risks. The first insurance

product, a regional catastrophe risk pool launched in
2021, is underpinned by the first regional near-realtime flood monitoring platform and risk model. This
enables governments to make better risk-informed
decisions before, during, and in the aftermath
of flooding.


The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility
(PPIAF) is helping to expand African markets
for pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) solar, a fast-growing
business model for off-grid lighting and electricity
solutions. Together with IFC, PPIAF created the

PAYGO Market Attractiveness Index, which PAYGO

operators are using to assess demand, supply, and
enabling factors at a country-by-country level.
Policymakers can also use it to identify gaps and


Support Facility (CSF) helped Ethiopia assess
its Climate Resilient Green Economy Strategy for

##### **RESILIENCE AND LOW-CARBON** **DEVELOPMENT IN THE AMAZON**

Since 2015, the Forest Conservation and

Sustainability in the Heart of the Colombian
Amazon Project has played a critical role in reducing
deforestation, conserving biodiversity, and fostering
climate resilience in the Amazon. It represents longterm commitment and cooperation among donors,
the government, and community organizations,
with co-financing from government resources,
bilateral cooperation agencies, and three rounds of
FIF funding from the Global Environment Facility
(GEF) implemented by the World Bank, the most
recent of which was approved in 2021.


Investments are helping to strengthen the
management of protected areas—including the
Serranía de Chiribiquete National Park, the world’s
largest national tropical rainforest protected area
at 4.3 million hectares—and assisting national
and subnational public institutions to mainstream
environmental criteria into different areas of
agriculture, mining, infrastructure, and land-use
planning. Colombia’s forest and carbon monitoring
systems are also being supported.


[The project is also enhancing the capacity of](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3f912a4e128f42b1870aafb4fdf9c7ec)
[Indigenous and rural communities to undertake](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3f912a4e128f42b1870aafb4fdf9c7ec)
sustainable landscape management practices.
Participatory community land-use planning
processes have led to increased ecosystem
connectivity and strengthened climate resilience
in target areas. To date, rural households have



![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-28-6.png)





develop agroforestry activities on over 48,000
hectares, conserving more than 40 percent of their
farmland. In parallel, the government and research
institutions are helping rural communities increase
incomes and food security through climatesmart livelihood alternatives that also strengthen
low-carbon development and restore productive

natural resources.


The local planning approach has proven so
successful that the government has expanded it to
reach 12,000 households in the Amazon region as
outlined in the National Development Plan. Newly
approved GEF financing will help scale up efforts to
strengthen management and financial sustainability
of additional protected areas, and it will build on
the results of local community agreements to
expand the area under sustainable community
forestry practices.

### **GENDER**

The pandemic has exposed existing social
and economic inequities even more glaringly.

Lockdowns, school closures, and economic

downturn have disproportionately impacted the
education, employment, and domestic lives of
women and girls. The World Bank Group recognizes
that major challenges like pandemics affect people
differentially, often to the detriment of women and
girls due to discriminatory laws and policies, as
well as ingrained gender and social norms. It also
recognizes that no country, community, or economy
can achieve its potential without the full and equal
participation of all its people.


The World Bank Group is working to narrow gender
gaps and elevate women as agents of economic
growth, stability, and sustainability. Trust funds are
helping to accelerate progress on human capital,
increase women’s access to good jobs and asset
ownership, and amplify women’s voice and agency.


For example, the State and Peace Building Fund

![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-29-3.png)

(SPF) helped pilot the Integrated Platform for
Gender-based Violence Prevention and Response
in four districts of Nepal back in 2016 to raise
awareness about gender-based violence and
improve services for survivors. A 24-hour toll-free
helpline was launched to link survivors with shelter,
psychosocial support, legal aid, and child support
services provided by CSOs. The National Women
Commission has since taken ownership of the
project and expanded services nationwide, with the
helpline providing nearly 13,500 integrated services

to over 21,000 clients.

![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-29-5.png)


The Competitive Industries and Innovation
Program (CIIP) financed studies on building greater

resilience and inclusion in the fisheries sector in

Mauritania’s Nouadhibou Free Zone, a major hub for



fresh fish exports. The goal is to connect small-scale
fishermen and informal processors and traders
(generally women) to the value chain. Both the
government and the private sector are focused on
building women’s entrepreneurship and other skills
in this artisanal processing sector.


World Bank Group-implemented funding from the
Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi)
and the Doing Business Pakistan Project supported
a partnership between the Government of Pakistan
and the World Bank Group’s Women, Business
and the Law Advisory Program that informed an
amendment to Pakistan’s Companies Act. Passed
in 2020, the amendment lifts the requirement for
women entrepreneurs to provide the name of their
father or husband during the company incorporation

##### **EAST AFRICA: MAKING MOBILE** **MONEY MORE ACCESSIBLE TO** **WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE**

Agriculture is the largest source of employment
for women in developing countries, with women
representing more than 60 percent of the agricultural
labor force in some parts of Asia and Africa. Yet,
women farmers have significantly less access to
productive assets, including financial services.
Digital financial services, accessed largely through
mobile devices, have expanded the availability
of financial products to smallholder farmers and
represent a safe and convenient way to save, obtain
loans, and make or receive payments. However,

in low- and middle-income countries, women are

36 percent less likely than men to own mobile

money accounts.



The Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality
(UFGE) is supporting efforts to promote greater
financial inclusion. It funded an assessment,

[Mobile Technologies and Digitized Data to Promote](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/855471513670397514/pdf/Mobile-technologies-and-digitized-data-to-promote-access-to-finance-for-women-in-agriculture.pdf)


Fenix (now Engie Energy Access), an off-grid solar
home system provider in Uganda, invested in new
tools to better gather feedback from its women
clients. It has since adapted the tools for other
markets and is using them in countries like Benin.


Safaricom’s Digifarm, a digital platform that offers

financial and non-financial services to smallholder

farmers in Kenya, partnered with a commercial
bank to offer savings products better tailored to the
financial needs of women involved in agriculture. It
also engaged with women’s groups to build trust
and understanding of financial products. Women
now account for 48 percent of clients for multiple
Digifarm products, a 10 to 15 percent increase since
technical assistance began.


MyAgro, a social enterprise that offers bundled
services to farmers in Tanzania, also adopted new
marketing mechanisms. It engaged influential
women in leadership to encourage others to enroll
in programs, and created marketing products with
images and terminology familiar to local women
involved in agriculture. MyAgro also made services
more accessible by reducing the minimum package
size and associated prices.

and predictable disbursements of cash transfers
to 30 percent of the Zambian population and 50
percent of the poor by 2022.



![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-30-5.png)

A 2019 impact evaluation showed that the SCT
program is contributing to increased human
capital and productivity, both key to enhancing
greater resilience. Households were found to have
increased the land they operate by 18 percent,
maize production by 8 percent, and livestock by 21
percent. Households also increased their ability to
meet the material needs of children (clothes, shoes,

blankets) by 30 percent and increased the number
of children attending primary school by 10 percent.


### **SOCIAL PROTECTION & JOBS**



Social protection programs are at the heart of
boosting human capital for the world’s most
vulnerable. Not only can they cushion the impact
of crises like COVID-19, but at any time, they
can empower people to be healthy, pursue their
education, and seek opportunity to lift themselves
and their families out of poverty. Social protection
systems that are well-designed and implemented
can enhance human capital and productivity,
reduce inequalities, build resilience, and end intergenerational cycles of poverty.


Funding from trust funds is helping the World Bank to
expand successful programs, pilot new approaches,

and build the evidence base on what works and

what does not in policies and programs for social
safety nets and sustainable social insurance.


For example, the Identification for Development
Initiative (ID4D) brought together a multi-sectoral
team from across the World Bank to support the
Government of the Philippines in developing its

![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-30-4.png)
new national Philippine Identification System
(PhilSys). Proof of identity is the key to accessing

social and financial services, and those who lacked

proper documentation can be locked out. PhilSys
aims to register more than 90 million Filipinos and
accelerate the country’s transition to an inclusive and
resilient digital economy, society, and government.
Integrating best practices for inclusion, data privacy,
and digital security, ID4D also helped adapt the
registration approach for COVID-19 to prioritize

low-income households that would benefit most

from a digital ID to access social protection and

financial services.



The Sudan Transition and Recovery Support
(STARS) program, an umbrella coordination platform
for World Bank engagement in Sudan, is supporting
the economic and peacebuilding transition after the
collapse of the former regime in November 2019.
As part of a larger sustainable livelihoods project,
STARS provided technical support and financing to
promote youth entrepreneurship. Over 1,000 young
people, 70 percent of whom were women, received
technical and vocational skills training, while another
1,400 women received home cultivation training.
The project also established a permanent incubator,
the Inventors Development Center, to nurture and
train young Sudanese entrepreneurs and creators
in areas like medicine, engineering, electronics, and
information technology.


European Commission, the World Bank brought
critical global knowledge to the task of implementing

### **DEBT MANAGEMENT**



![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-31-1.png)

![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-31-2.png)
##### **FISCAL RESILIENCE**

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a steep
increase in public debt across the world, including
in Georgia. The government had to borrow
substantially to finance stringent health measures,
fiscal stimulus packages, and the deficit due to
falling tax revenues. Hence, Georgia increased
domestic debt issuance and, with additional support
from development partners, the country was able
to meet its government’s financing needs at a time
when capital markets were in turmoil. Fortunately,
[Georgia had already built a framework for greater](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2019/07/11/irakli-katcharava-the-dmf-and-georgia)
[resilience, with support from the DMF, prior to](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2019/07/11/irakli-katcharava-the-dmf-and-georgia)
the pandemic.


The DMF started providing technical assistance to
Georgia in 2013 with an initial Debt Management
Performance Assessment followed by a reform plan
and several support missions for domestic debt
market development. The assessment identified
several areas of weaknesses in government debt
management processes and procedures, as well as
in the structure of debt and guarantees management.


Through the assessment, reform plans, and training
opportunities, the DMF catalyzed significant
progress in Georgia’s debt management and
assisted the country in reducing vulnerability
to financial shocks. DMF training opportunities
also improved the analytical capacity of debt



![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-31-6.png)



Debt financing is critical for development, but
unsustainable levels harm growth and the poor.
Debt can be a useful tool if it is transparent, wellmanaged, and used in the context of a credible
growth policy, but this is often not the case. High
public debt can inhibit private investment, increase
fiscal pressure, reduce social spending, and limit
governments’ ability to implement reforms.


The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated debt
stress in many emerging and developing economies,
with increased spending on health, incomes, and
employment. It has forced some countries to borrow
more and compromised others’ ability to repay
creditors. For a resilient recovery, debt management
and transparency need to be top priorities, along

with domestic resource mobilization. The World

Bank is helping countries around the world to
strengthen their capacity to manage debt and tax
revenue generation, with trust funds providing
important resources for technical assistance
and guidance.

![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-31-3.png)


For example, the Debt Management Facility (DMF)
helps countries strengthen debt management to
reduce debt-related vulnerabilities and improve debt
transparency. It offers advisory services, training, and
peer-to-peer learning to more than 80 developing
countries around the world to strengthen their debt
management capacity, processes, and institutions.



DMF efforts have led to more countries preparing and
publishing debt management strategies, improving
the quality of government debt records, and better
organizing their debt management institutions and
coordination with fiscal policies through alignment

with medium-term fiscal frameworks.


The Global Tax Program (GTP) enhances the
World Bank’s capacity to support tax reforms,
especially at this crucial time. The program provides
an umbrella framework for tax support and leads an
ongoing program of activities at both international
tax and country levels focused on strengthening tax
institutions and mobilizing revenues.


For example, the GTP is funding the Kyrgyz
Republic Tax Reform Technical Assistance Project,

taxpayer communication and outreach, rebuilding
business processes, and digitizing the issuance





and formulate debt management strategies.


Since the initial DMF engagement in 2013, Georgia
has improved debt management transparency
with the publication of a semi-annual public
debt statistical bulletin, monthly debt statistics,
and annual debt sustainability analysis. The
government has also developed and published debt
management strategies, which provide guidance
for borrowing operations and lay out measures for
domestic market development. Cash management
has also improved with the establishment of a cash
management unit in the Ministry of Finance and the
introduction of weekly and daily cash flow forecasts
and active investment of surplus cash.

##### **MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH** **AFRICA: BUILDING THE** **CAPACITY OF SMES** **TO NAVIGATE COVID 19**

When IFC conducted its 2018 Advisory Services
Client Survey, clients identified skills training as
the most anticipated need for the coming years.
COVID-19 only heightened this need. Many
micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs),
especially those with weak financial and business
management skills, are finding it difficult to navigate
and exit the COVID-19 crisis on a strong footing.

MSMEs in the Middle East and North Africa

(MENA) region, in particular, have been slower to
digitize their operations and move to online sales
and e-commerce than in other regions. COVID-19
lockdown measures forced many MSMEs to
suspend activities entirely.



![](./markdowns/images/2021TrustFundAnnualReports.pdf-32-1.png)


##### **3.2 IFC TRUST FUNDS**

IFC is also focused on building resilience. The GRID
approach is apparent in its work with the private
sector, whose role in development has never been
more important than in the wake of COVID-19.


IFC is deploying a comprehensive approach, utilizing
the Creating Markets Upstream approach, Advisory

services, and blended finance trust funds, to

address protracted development challenges around
the globe and build a pipeline of investment projects
that will accelerate recovery after the pandemic.
This constellation of IFC services will help pave the
way for private sector investment in everything from
climate change to digital infrastructure. Together
with the contributions of development partners,
IFC is de-risking emerging technologies, opening
frontier markets, and delivering greater impact on
the ground.


This work is informed by Country Private Sector
Diagnostics many of which are co-funded with
development partners, [7] and driven by IFC Country
Strategies. The diagnostics bring together the
combined expertise of the World Bank and IFC to
better align country-level engagement in regard
to private sector development, including with
development partners.


An important component is IFC Advisory services,
which are long-term engagements that build
capacity and enable markets. As governments
and companies have had to navigate multiple,
compounding shocks during the past year,
IFC’s work is helping to build the foundation for
greater resilience.


Advisory projects on digital financial services, for
example, have helped governments revise their
legislation to enable financial institutions to launch
online banking services. As COVID-19 forced the
closure of many brick-and-mortar bank branches,



digital financial services have filled the void, making
it possible for SMEs to continue to access financial
services. Work with municipalities and infrastructure
projects have helped to attract private capital for
public projects, freeing up government resources
for other needs, while general capacity building

for SMEs has enabled them to access increased

financing to meet short-term liquidity needs.


In West Africa, the travel and tourism industry lost
nearly 30 percent of tourism-related jobs in 2020
due to the pandemic, which exposed an overdependence on foreign travelers. IFC had been
working to strengthen local tourism value chains
through the Invest West Africa Tourism project
funded by two global funds, IFC Support for G-20
Compact with Africa Initiative (ISCA) and the

Trust Fund to Facilitate USAID Access to IFC

Advisory Service’s Expertise and Services. In
light of COVID-19, IFC shifted its focus to supporting
companies to access additional sources of financing
and identify domestic markets. IFC provided
coaching to 18 supplier companies and worked with
Côte d’Ivoire’s private-sector support committee
to develop an online platform that helps affected
companies identify and apply for loans, grants, and
other financing support.


Trust funds are also supporting countries to build
greener, more resilient energy sectors. IFC has
been advising the government of Uzbekistan to
transition from natural gas to solar energy through
the country’s first competitively tendered PPP, the
Uzbekistan Solar Project. A group of six trust funds [8 ]

is supporting this effort. The success of this tender,
which will bring the lowest tariff for solar energy in
Central Asia, has spurred the government to launch
two additional solar projects expected to add an
additional 900 MW of solar generation capacity in
the country. Going forward, this will help boost the
resilience of Uzbekistan’s energy supply through
renewable energy.



In 2020, IFC launched the [Grow Learn Connect](https://www.growlearnconnect.org/)

[project](https://www.growlearnconnect.org/) with support from several trust funds,
including the MENA MSME 2.0 Trust Fund
and the Partnership for Resilient Efficient and
Sustainable SMEs Facility. Recognizing that
financial institutions play an important role in
enabling their MSME clients to mitigate business

financial risks and maintain access to finance, the

Grow Learn Connect team developed an interactive
webinar series for MSMEs, focused on increasing
business resilience and delivered through financial
institutions. It covered topics such as how to access
financing during crises, doing business online, and
communicating with stakeholders during crises. In
partnership with seven financial institutions, IFC

delivered the webinar series to more than 1,100

participants in six countries.


IFC will also work directly with financial institutions
to create awareness about the benefits of offering
nonfinancial services to MSMEs, such as business

development services and access to information
and markets, to complement and increase uptake of
their financial services. Although the program was
born out of a need to respond to COVID-19, IFC’s
work in building skills and knowledge for financial

institutions and MSMEs in MENA will benefit

both types of institutions and result in companies
that are better equipped to navigate the post
COVID-19 world.

The Global Partnership for Education (GPE)
has implemented one of the largest external aid
programs dedicated to education in the global
pandemic response. By June 2020, GPE had secured
$500 million to establish a new accelerated funding
window for COVID-19 response and recovery
measures through which grants of $467 million have
helped 66 partner countries mitigate the impact of
the pandemic on children’s learning and build more
resilient education systems. The World Bank has
been a major implementing entity for these funds

(Section 2.2).


As a result of streamlined application and approval
processes, the accelerated funding window
has facilitated the swift delivery of support to

countries most in need, with all funds disbursed to

implementing entities by June 2021. The window
required GPE funds to be based on the recipients’
own response plan, to be complementary to other
sources of COVID-19 support, and to be focused
on reaching vulnerable populations (including
girls, children with disabilities, poor, or displaced
children) who are most susceptible to fall further
behind during the pandemic.


The AgResults Initiative uses Pay-for-Results (PfR)
prize competitions to incentivize the private sector
to develop and deliver productivity-enhancing
technologies to smallholder farmers. Its Challenge
Projects demonstrate how to encourage local
actors to develop linkages along selected value
chains to address formerly missing markets with

contextualized and more resilient solutions. The

Vietnam GHG Emissions Reduction Challenge
Project (2017–21) incentivized improved rice
cultivation practices both to increase productivity
and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The
Tanzania Dairy Challenge Project (launched in
November 2019) is incentivizing private sector
suppliers to deliver productivity-enhancing input
bundles (parasite control, nutrition, vaccines,
artificial insemination) to both men and women

smallholder dairy farmers in a socially inclusive way.



Sustainable infrastructure is key to delivering
economic growth, social progress, and climate
action in line with the SDGs and Paris Agreement

commitments. Created in 2014, the Global

Infrastructure Facility (GIF) is tackling head-on

the dearth of bankable, sustainable infrastructure

pipelines in developing countries through the
provision of end-to-end transaction advisory
services to national and subnational governments
through ten MDB Technical Partners.


The GIF supports developing country governments
not only to prioritize, design, and structure

individual low-carbon, climate-smart infrastructure

transactions, but also to encourage programmatic
approaches, including standardization efforts, that
can lead to replication and aggregation. The goal
is to appeal to institutional capital through better
coordination with governments and development
finance institutions. The GIF is heavily promoting
climate mitigation, adaption and resilience: to date,
74 percent of its current portfolio and 85 percent of
its pipeline activities are climate-smart.


##### **3.3 FINANCIAL** **INTERMEDIARY FUNDS**

FIFs are important financial vehicles that channel
large-scale grant and concessional financing for
critical global issues. Like trust funds, many FIFs
support activities relate to the GRID approach and
help to scale up collective action in health, climate,
gender, jobs, and debt sustainability.


More than half (56 percent) of FIF resources were
transferred to health programs during FY2017–21,
and one quarter (25 percent) to environment
and climate-related programs. This includes five
health-related FIFs that support equitable access
to COVID-19 vaccines, pandemic preparedness,
and other aspects of the COVID-19 response
(Section 2.1) and 12 FIFs that contribute to a range

of environmental and climate-related activities.

Other FIFs contribute to education, gender equality,

infrastructure, and debt relief.


The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed

the context in which the work of climate-related FIFs

is taking place. Urgent and sizeable development
assistance is needed to support governments,
businesses, and communities to recover quickly

from the economic downturn and rebuild for a

greener, sustainable, and more resilient future.
Pursuing low-emission and climate-resilient growth
is the best way to unlock lasting socio-economic
and environmental benefits. Coupling large-scale

financial investments with technical assistance in the

context of COVID-19 lending is advancing climatefriendly policy reforms. Investments in clean energy
are creating millions of jobs, while strengthening key

economic sectors, to bolster COVID-19 recoveries.


For example, the Climate Investment Funds (CIF)
provide concessional financing for innovation and
de-risking alongside multilateral development bank
(MDB) investments in developing countries. The
World Bank has been CIF’s largest implementing
partner, disbursing roughly 50 percent of the funds.



In April 2020 CIF introduced four new programs
in the areas of renewable energy integration,

climate-smart urbanization, low-carbon and

climate-resilient industries, and nature, people, and

climate investments. In March 2021, it launched

the Accelerating Coal Transition (ACT) program,
which offers a holistic approach to tackling the
governance, people, and infrastructure challenges
related to transitioning away from coal. In June 2021,
four donors (Canada, Germany, USA, and the United
Kingdom) announced new financial commitments
of up to $2 billion to support ACT and renewable
energy integration in developing countries.


The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has
implemented a variety of measures to assist
countries in addressing the evolving challenges
arising from the pandemic and to support efforts in
building back better, greener, and more resilient. Its
work embraces all facets of a healthy environment,
including climate change, biodiversity loss,
chemical pollution, and pressure on forests, oceans,
landscapes, and wildlife.


The GEF has a central role in restoring a better
balance between people and nature and in
addressing the underlying factors of zoonotic
diseases, such as the global wildlife trade. GEF’s
integrated programs—the Good Growth Platform,
the Sustainable Cities Impact Program, the Food,
Land Use, and Restoration Impact Program, and the
Wildlife Conservation for Development Program—
are helping countries to build economies and
societies that will thrive despite inevitable future
shocks. The proposed GEF-8 strategy for 2022–26
will continue to build on this systemic approach
by applying a Healthy Planet, Healthy People
framework to develop a healthy, productive and
resilient planet that underpins the well-being of

human societies.

(GCF), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness

Innovations (CEPI), and the Global Environment

Facility (GEF). Almost 80 percent of this increase is
to CEPI for the COVID-19 response.


Development partners recognize the strategic
advantages of entrusting their resources with
the World Bank Group. It has the technical
expertise, country experience, and supervision and
reporting capacity to ensure funds are directed to
development activities that align with agreed
priorities and achieve impact at scale. Efficiency,
relevance, global reach, and influential convening
power are all reasons why development partners

choose to contribute to trust funds and FIFs

managed by the World Bank Group.


OUTFLOWS


Outflows, or disbursements from World Bank Group

trust funds and cash transfers from FIFs, have

increased in the last five years to reach $12.97 billion

in FY2021. IBRD/IDA trust fund disbursements

were $3.57 billion in FY2021, an increase of 2

percent ($75 million) from FY2020. RE activities
accounted for around 71 percent ($2.55 billion) of
total disbursements and BE activities 29 percent
($1.03 billion). The higher disbursements were
driven mainly by STARS, the Global Partnership for
Education (IBRD as implementing entity), and the
Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (IBRD as
implementing entity).


Annual cash transfers from FIFs to implementing

entities increased from $7.66 billion in FY2020

to $10.03 billion in FY2021. The increase in cash

transfers was driven by the International Finance
Facility for Immunisation; the Global Fund to Fight

AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund);

and the Advanced Market Commitments for

Pneumococcal Vaccines for their support in helping
countries strengthen health systems and mitigate
the impact of COVID-19. Cash transfers from
FIFs include transfers for all purposes, including
secretariat costs and administrative expenses.

## T he World Bank Group’s trust funds and FIFs are strong proof of what

can be accomplished when development

partners work together to move toward
greater resilience. Analysis of key financial
trends across Bank Group trust funds

and FIFs further underscores the forward

momentum of this shared commitment.


This chapter provides aggregate financial

information on the activities of trust funds and FIFs

administered individually or jointly by the World
Bank, IFC, MIGA, and ICSID, as well as externally
financed outputs (EFOs). It looks at five-year

trends, from FY2017 to FY2021, on trust fund and FIF

inflows, outflows, and assets under management—
all of which demonstrate the World Bank Group’s
position as the partner of choice to advance
development agendas in countries, regions, and
around the globe. Box 4.1 defines financial terms and
Table 4.1 provides an overview of key financial data.


INFLOWS


Inflows, or contributions to World Bank Group trust
funds and FIF, have remained strong and have shown
an increase over the last five years, reaching $14.31
billion in FY2021. In particular, cash contributions to

IBRD/IDA trust funds rose to $4.08 billion in FY2021,

an increase of 11 percent ($414 million) from FY2020
primarily driven by cash contributions to the Sudan
Transition and Recovery Support Program (STARS),
the Global Financing Facility (GFF), and the Sint
Maarten Recovery and Resilience Program.


IFC trust fund contributions increased by 18 percent
($48 million) in FY2021 compared to FY2020. Paid-in
contributions (cash and promissory notes receipts)

to FIFs increased from $8.94 billion in FY2020 to $9.91

billion in FY2021. This increase was primarily due to

increased contributions to the Green Climate Fund



**Chapter 4. Financial Analytics of World Bank Group Trust Funds and FIFs** **51**


The World Bank Group is strategic in deploying
trust fund and FIF resources to complement its own
funding and deepen support for specific objectives
shared by clients and donors, as well as to deliver
timely financial responses to emergencies like the

COVID-19 crisis. The share of FIF resources that

the World Bank implements reflect this strategic
alignment. Nearly one-third (28 percent) of trust fund
disbursements for RE activities during the last five
years have come from FIF resources implemented
by the World Bank.


Trust fund support for advisory services that the
Bank Group provides to public and private sector
clients is also significant. Nearly all of IFC’s Advisory

services and two-thirds of the World Bank’s ASA

are funded by trust funds, allowing the Bank Group
to build knowledge, inform policy dialogue, and
enhance enabling environments. Trust-funded
activities also bring World Bank Group support

to locations outside the immediate reach of its

financing instruments.


ASSET MANAGEMENT


Asset management is another important way in
which the World Bank Group brings value to trust
fund and FIF partnerships. As trustee, the World
Bank receives and invests development partner

contributions to trust funds and FIFs until funds



are disbursed to final recipients for development
objectives. In FY2017–21, investment income earned
on trust fund and FIF funds held in trust (FHIT)

totaled $2.66 billion.


The trust fund and FIF portfolios have grown
over the years due to an increase in development
partners’ contributions for multi-year projects, an
increase in the number of trust funds managed by
the World Bank Group, and investment returns. As
of June 30, 2021, the amount of funds held by the
World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs reached
$40.24 billion. The top three IBRD/IDA programs
with large amounts of FHIT (cash and investments)
were the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund,

the Carbon Finance Fund, and the GFF, and the

top three FIFs were the GCF, GEF, and the Climate

Investment Funds.


The World Bank’s investment management services
aim to preserve donor funds and enhance their
value while accommodating the varying liquidity
needs and risk preferences of different trust funds
and FIFs. Participating funds benefit from access
to a wide variety of investment products and longer
terms of maturity to enhance investment returns
over time. Environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) investment solutions and product offerings
also cater to the sustainable responsible investing
aspirations of participating funds.

by Norway, the Netherlands, and Germany.
Intergovernmental institutions contributed 16

ANNUAL TRANSFERS FROM FIFS TO THE WORLD BANK GROUP AS

IMPLEMENTING ENTITY [14,15 ]


Transfers from FIFs to projects implemented by the World Bank Group decreased from 11 percent of the total
transfers from FIFs to all implementing entities in FY2020 ($0.8 billion) to 8 percent in FY2021 ($0.7 billion).
The largest transfer amounts in FY2021 were from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) at $215 million,
followed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) at $154 million and the Climate Investment Funds (CIF)
at $96 million. On a cumulative basis spanning FY2017–21, the World Bank Group as an implementing entity
received the largest amount of transfers from the GPE ($1.3 billion), followed by CIF ($1.1 billion) and the Global
Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) ($0.6 billion).

to an increase of $2.93 billion in transfers from the

International Finance Facility for Immunisation;
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and

Malaria; and the Advanced Market Commitments for

Pneumococcal Vaccines in response to COVID-19.
This was offset by a decrease in transfers from the
Climate Investment Funds, the Global Environment

Facility, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations, and the Global Agriculture and Food
Security Program.


IBRD/IDA TRUST FUND

DISBURSEMENTS FROM TOP 20

TRUST FUND PROGRAMS


In FY2017–21, the top 20 trust fund programs
accounted for 63 percent of the total IBRD/IDA trust
fund disbursements ($18.46 billion). The highest
disbursements were made from the Afghanistan
Reconstruction Trust Fund ($3.90 billion), followed

by other large disbursements made by the World
Bank in its role as implementing entity for FIFs like
the Global Partnership for Education ($1.49 billion),

the Climate Investment Funds ($1.08 billion) and the

Global Environment Facility ($0.91 billion).



14 An implementing entity is any agency that receives funds from a FIF and is responsible for managing those funds for activities as
approved by the governing body.
15 Transfers to implementing entities include transfers for project preparation, supervision fees, project implementation, and special
agreement transfers for HIPC and AMC. However, in the case of the Global Fund, there is a lump sum transfer to the secretariat, and
the use of the transferred funds is determined by the Global Fund. The GEF Secretariat acts as an implementing entity for a limited
number of projects, i.e. the National Portfolio Formulation Exercises. Transfers to implementing entities exclude a one-time transfer
of $383 million from the GEF to IBRD to cover reevaluation of grants denominated in Special Drawing Rights (from 2004). Non-USD
transfers are valued as of June 30, 2021.


##### **4.2 OUTFLOWS**

DISBURSEMENTS AND CASH

TRANSFERS


Total World Bank Group trust fund disbursements
were $3.82 billion in FY2021. The marginal increase

in disbursements and cash transfers from IBRD/IDA

trust funds in FY2021 were mainly from the Sudan
Transition and Recovery Support Program (up by
$95 million) and IBRD as an implementing entity
of the Global Partnership for Education (up by $67
million) and the Pandemic Emergency Financing
Facility (up by $63 million). IBRD/IDA trust funds
accounted for 94 percent of World Bank Group

disbursements and cash transfers from trust funds

in FY2021, and IFC trust funds accounted for the

remaining 6 percent.


FIFs continue to play a significant role in the
international aid architecture. The average amount
of annual transfers from FIFs during FY2017–21

was $7.37 billion. The annual transfer from FIFs to

implementing entities increased from $7.66 billion
in FY2020 to $10.03 billion in FY2021, primarily due

IBRD/IDA TRUST FUND DISBURSEMENTS BY COUNTRY ELIGIBILITY


Cumulative IBRD/IDA trust fund disbursements for RE activities during FY2017–21 were $13.29 billion. The
highest annual level of $2.92 billion in FY2017 decreased to $2.55 billion in FY2021. IDA countries continue
to receive the largest share of disbursements for RE activities year after year, with 66 percent of total RE
disbursements in FY2021. Over the past five years, approximately $1 out of every $9 disbursed to IDA and IDAIBRD blend countries [16] was from trust-funded RE activities. Approximately 19 percent of the total trust fund

disbursements for RE activities were to IBRD countries.


Out of $5.2 billion in cumulative trust fund disbursements for BE activities during the last five years, about $1
billion were for activities that support IDA countries. Compared to FY2017, trust fund disbursements for BE
activities to support IDA countries declined by 6 percent to $191 million in FY2021, trust fund disbursements for
BE activities to support IBRD-IDA blend countries dropped by 25 percent to $50 million in FY2021, and trust
fund disbursements for BE activities to support IBRD countries grew by 29 percent to $196 million in FY2021.

DISBURSEMENTS FROM IBRD, IDA, AND TRUST FUNDS FOR RE ACTIVITIES


Trust funds regularly co-finance IBRD and IDA projects, increasing scale and reach and filling knowledge
and financing gaps. They provide grant financing where client countries are reluctant to borrow, reducing
transactions costs and allowing development partners to build on World Bank Group technical and operational
capacity to maximize impact. During the past five years, trust fund disbursements for RE activities in client
countries have averaged 7 percent of total World Bank RE disbursements—a share that peaked at 9 percent in
FY2017 and fell to 5 percent in FY2021.


Total trust fund disbursements from RE activities (including stand-alone trust funds, co-financing trust funds,
and other trust funds) [18] declined by 13 percent from $2.92 billion in FY2017 to $2.55 billion in FY2021. This decline
was primarily due to lower disbursements from the following trust fund programs: Afghanistan Reconstruction
Trust Fund, IBRD as an implementing entity for FIFs (i.e., Global Partnership for Education, Climate Investment
Funds, and Global Environment Facility), and the Carbon Finance Fund. IBRD and IDA disbursements also
varied during FY2017–21, with increased disbursements in FY2021 compared to FY2020 to combat the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic.


Stand-alone trust fund disbursements for RE activities decreased from $1.48 billion in FY2017 to $0.68 billion

in FY2021, or 27 percent of total FY2021 trust fund disbursements for RE activities ($2.55 billion). Meanwhile,
disbursements from co-financing trust funds continued an upward trajectory, from 36 percent ($1.04 billion) of
total trust fund disbursements for RE activities in FY2017 to 62 percent ($1.58 billion) in FY2021. Rounding out
FY2021 disbursements were grants that financed other lending projects ($0.26 billion).



TRUST FUND DISBURSEMENTS FOR RE ACTIVITIES IN STATES AFFECTED BY

FRAGILITY, CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE


RE grants are important financing instruments to respond to the needs of states affected by FCV. While trust
fund disbursements for RE activities in these countries decreased in absolute amounts from $1.36 billion in

FY2017 to $1.27 billion in FY2021, their share increased from 46 percent in FY2017 to 50 percent in FY2021.


In FY2021, Afghanistan accounted for a significant portion (51 percent, $0.65 billion) of total trust fund
disbursements for RE activities in states affected by FCV followed by Sudan ($119 million), the West Bank and
Gaza ($100 million), Mozambique ($79 million), Democratic Republic of Congo ($60 million), and Somalia ($39
million). RE disbursements to countries affected by FCV (excluding Afghanistan) averaged around $0.5 billion

in FY2017–21.

REGIONAL SHARES OF TRUST FUND DISBURSEMENTS FOR RE ACTIVITIES


Among the World Bank’s Regional Units, the South Asia Region (SAR) was the largest beneficiary of trust fund
disbursements for RE activities, with $840 million in FY2021. The Eastern and Southern Africa Region (AFE)
was the second largest beneficiary at $694 million, followed by the Western and Central Africa (AFW) at $225
million, Latin America and Caribbean (LCR) at $221 million, East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) at $196 million, and

Europe and Central Asia (ECA) at $152 million.


Compared with FY2020, trust fund disbursements for RE activities in AFE increased by 21 percent in FY2021,
primarily due to an increase in disbursement from the Sudan Transition and Recovery Support Program ($95
million), IBRD as implementing entity for the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) ($42 million), and the
Somalia Multi Partner Fund ($19 million). Trust fund disbursements for RE activities in SAR increased by 6
percent mainly driven by an increase in disbursements from the Community and Capacity Development
Support Program ($14 million), IBRD as implementing entity for the Global Environment Facility ($9 million),
and the IBRD as implementing entity for GPE ($8 million).



WORLD BANK RECIPIENT-EXECUTED DISBURSEMENTS FUNDED FROM FIFS


In FY2021, FIFs financed a significant proportion (25 percent) of total trust fund disbursements to RE activities
supervised by the World Bank. The share for the last five years is at 28 percent. The volume and share of the
FIF funding have declined during the last five years from $861 million (29 percent) in FY2017 to $631 million
(25 percent) in FY2021. Almost one-third of the funding during FY2017–2021 was from the Global Partnership

for Education.

DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR ADVISORY SERVICES AND ANALYTICS


Trust fund financing for BE activities represents a significant share of the World Bank’s expenditures on ASA
at 63 percent in FY2021. This large share of externally financed ASA provides opportunities to work with
development partners on the knowledge agenda, while also introducing challenges to the Bank’s ability to plan
and align its work to its strategic priorities. These challenges are being addressed as a part of the ongoing trust

fund reforms.


##### **4.3 ASSETS**

Trust fund assets consist of funds held in trust (FHIT)—cash, investments, promissory notes and contribution
receivables. These assets are managed and reported separately for IBRD/IDA trust funds, IFC trust funds, and
FIFs following established reporting protocols.


INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT


The World Bank manages the liquid assets of trust funds and FIFs in a single, commingled investment pool that
provides the following benefits to its participants:


- A selection of sub-portfolios or model portfolios to accommodate varying liquidity needs and risk
preferences of different funds, managed within a comprehensive risk management framework


- Access to a wide variety of investment products and longer terms of maturity to enhance investment

returns over time


- Regular review of liquidity needs across funds to optimize investments over the longer term


Standardized and customized ESG investment solutions and product offerings to cater to various
sustainable responsible investing (SRI) aspirations of individual funds


These investments earn income based on the trust fund’s share of interest income, realized gains or losses
from the sale of securities, and unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the asset value held by the
pool at fair value. During FY2017–21, investment income on trust fund and FIF assets totaled $2.66 billion, with
a peak in FY2019 at $882 million and a decline in FY2021 to $201 million.

68 WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021 Chapter 4. Financial Analytics of World Bank Group Trust Funds and FIFs 69


ASSET MIX OF TRUST FUNDS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO


Upon receipt of development partner contributions to a trust fund, the World Bank invests these resources in
the international capital markets until they are disbursed to final recipients. Trust fund assets are managed with
the primary investment objective of capital preservation and liquidity on demand.


The provisions of the World Bank’s General Investment Authorizations for IBRD and IDA also apply to the
investment of trust fund assets. Accordingly, these assets are managed within conservative overall risk tolerance
parameters and invested in high quality securities, which include securities issued by sovereign governments,
government agencies, and multilateral and other official institutions, asset-backed and agency-guaranteed
mortgage-backed securities, as well as swaps and a range of derivatives in support of securities investments.
Subject to the primary investment objective, the asset mix among the investment products authorized by
the General Investment Authorizations is based on market opportunities available within the applicable risk
limits. As part of monitoring and financial and risk management oversight, a regular rebalancing of assets is
performed to ensure that enough liquidity is available to meet disbursements needs.


The portfolio asset allocation as of FY2021 reflects this conservative investment approach and defensive
positioning to maintain the portfolio within the policy risk tolerance. The portfolio includes a large allocation
of 40 percent invested in sovereign government bonds, followed by 19 percent in cash and money market
instruments, 13 percent in corporate-covered bonds, and 12 percent in agencies. The rest of the portfolio is
invested in sovereign government bonds, asset-backed securities, and a small allocation to equities.

manages and invests development partner financial resources.



ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND
GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS


There has been a major shift in the global asset
management industry toward sustainable and
responsible investing (SRI), with rapidly growing
awareness of global environmental, social, and
governance (ESG) issues. The World Bank Group is
committed to a more ambitious development agenda
focusing on the SDGs and helping client countries
to achieve their climate action targets. The Bank
Group takes pride in incorporating sustainabilityrelated themes in all operational activities, including
the investment management function entrusted to it
by its clients.


Since July 2019, the World Bank Treasury has
applied ESG Integration as the default SRI
approach for all portfolios managed by the
World Bank. ESG Integration explicitly considers
material ESG factors in the investment process
and is intended to help fulfil the existing
investment objectives without changes to the
current investment objectives or risk limits of the
portfolios for which it is used. Endorsed by World
Bank Management, ESG Integration is the most
appropriate SRI approach within the purview of

the IBRD/IDA General Investment Authorizations

and clients’ investment guidelines as stipulated in
the Investment Management Agreements.



The World Bank continues to explore additional SRI
strategies in line with the current market practices to
meet the evolving SRI aspirations and development
objectives of the development partners. In FY2021,
the World Bank implemented its Sustainable Bond
Strategy, which seeks to invest in high-grade
bond and cash instruments that generate positive
sustainable development impacts while retaining
the overarching investment objectives of the trust
funds and FIFs. The strategy is formulated based on

three core commitments:


- A focus on high-grade fixed-income investments
aiming to generate positive impact outcomes


- Fundamental fixed-income risk disciplines with
no compromise on returns


- Transparent and reliable impact reporting


The strategy is implemented following a gradual
and phased approach, alongside the development
of the sustainable bond market. Initially, it will focus
on sovereign bonds, governmental agency bonds,
and supra-national bonds through a process of
positive identification, wherein rigorous analytical
assessments are performed to identify bonds

from the investable universe that have verifiable

sustainability impact. In time, the strategy could
adopt the same sustainability methodology
of positive selection to a wider investment
universe, encompassing, for example, high-grade
corporate bonds.

FUNDS HELD IN TRUST


Funds held in trust (FHIT) are comprised of cash, investments, and promissory notes, or similar obligations,
received but not encashed at the end of the fiscal year. It reflects, at a point in time, contributions paid-in from

contributors and investment income earned less cash transfers from FIFs to IBRD/IDA trust funds when the

Bank acts as implementing entity for FIFs. The top decile of the IBRD/IDA trust funds (measured by FHIT) held
77 percent of total FHIT as of June 30, 2021.


These trust funds broadly demonstrate a link to high priority areas, such as states affected by FCV (Afghanistan,
West Bank and Gaza), themes (climate change), and support to the SDGs (health, nutrition, and population).
The bottom eight deciles held 12 percent of total FHIT. While the long tail of smaller funds can provide important
funding for innovation and knowledge, fragmentation poses challenges to linking with strategic priorities
and achieving greater development outcomes. Small, customized trust funds may also increase transactions
costs associated with fundraising, establishment, heterogeneous governance, results frameworks, and
reporting requirements.



DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS HELD IN TRUST


As of the end of FY2021, FHIT for IBRD/IDA trust funds was $12.44 billion (including $0.09 billion of MIGA trust
funds), an increase of 10 percent ($1.13 billion) compared to the end of FY2020. The increase was primarily due
to larger FHIT for the Sudan Transition and Recovery Support Program ($339 million), the Global Financing
Facility ($294 million), IBRD as an implementing entity for the Green Climate Fund ($155 million), and the
Canada Climate Innovation Financing Facility ($138 million). The FHIT for FIFs increased by $1.8 billion (7
percent) from $24.15 billion to $25.96 billion during FY2021. The increase was primarily due to larger FHIT for
the Green Climate Fund ($1.69 billion), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ($863 million),
the Global Environment Facility ($244 million), and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program

($166 million).

DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS


The amount of assets—comprising cash and investments, promissory notes receivable, and contributions
receivable—for World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs amounted to $54.21 billion at the end of FY2021. The
share of cash and investments amounted to 62 percent of total assets, and the share of contributions receivable
and promissory notes receivable was 26 percent and 12 percent, respectively. [21,22] FIFs held $35.68 billion (66
percent) at the end of FY2021, IBRD/IDA trust funds held $16.28 billion (30 percent), IFC trust funds $1.29 billion
(2 percent), and other trust funds $0.94 billion (2 percent).


##### **4.4 EXTERNALLY FINANCED OUTPUTS**

Externally financed outputs (EFOs) are funding instruments used for activities that have a finite time frame (36
months) and an upper limit of $2 million for receiving contributions. Activities that exceed these parameters do
not qualify for EFOs and trust funds then become the preferred instrument. EFOs can be used to support single
or multiple bank activities or outputs that are managed by the same Vice-Presidential Unit, are part of the same
project, and are consistent with the Bank’s work program.


EFO CONTRIBUTIONS PAID-IN


Total EFO contributions paid-in during FY2017–21 totaled $234 million, with the annual average contribution
paid-in at $47 million. The FY2021 contributions paid-in decreased by 39 percent (down by $22 million)
compared to FY2020.


Among World Bank Regions, the Eastern and Southern Africa Region (AFE) received the highest contributions
paid-in at 15 percent ($36 million) during FY2017–21, excluding global EFOs (38 percent). Recipient countries
such as Ethiopia, Malawi, Somalia, and Sudan received higher contributions that led to a spike in FY2019
contributions. AFE received an annual average of $7 million and the Middle East and North Africa Region
(MENA) received an annual average of $5 million during the five-year period.

21 Contributions receivable refers to any portion of a contribution that is not a qualified contribution, to be received in the form of cash or
a promissory note.
22 Promissory notes receivable refers to the balance of promissory notes not yet received in cash.
