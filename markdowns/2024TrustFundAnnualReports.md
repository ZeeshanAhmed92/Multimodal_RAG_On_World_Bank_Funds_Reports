Analyze how social protection systems in the Great Lakes Region have
been used in response to internal displacements, in order to adapt and
enhance the effectiveness and responsiveness of the social protection
systems. By rigorously assessing key impacts of social protection system
responses to significant internal displacement and returnee issues
on vulnerable and host communities in the region, the grant will allow
partners to jointly identify strengths and weaknesses and policy options to
proactively adapt and enhance the effectiveness and responsiveness of
their social protection systems.


Define investment priorities for tackling drivers of climate-related fragility
and enhancing social inclusion in rural collines, including identifying ways
to reduce climate-induced land-related conflicts. The grant is expected to
inform the design of new climate and development investments, which are
needed to restore the country’s fast-degrading landscapes under climate
change, secure land rights, and restore social cohesion among rural
populations living off fragile agricultural lands.


Support the Government of Ethiopia to assess the impacts of the conflict
across northern Ethiopia, laying the foundations for a longer-term recovery
and reconstruction strategy. The grant will develop a structured process
to facilitate dialogue, partnership, and consensus-building activities to
conduct a multi-dimensional assessment of conflict impacts and recovery
and reconstruction needs, and support prioritization and sequencing of
interventions in a resilient recovery and reconstruction strategy.


Enhance the capacity of implementing agencies to design, implement
and monitor high-quality gender communication activities to support
interventions on closing gender gaps and eliminating gender-based
violence in selected operations.

Study the key structural social issues underlying conflict in contemporary
Ethiopia to design a set of social policy actions that can inform a new
social development policy operation. The grant seeks to find answers to
what aspects of social policy could help forge social bonding between and
amongst heterogenous communities that are polarized along ethnocultural
and identarian lines and thereby inform thinking on specific social actions
that could support conflict transformation. The grant will significantly
contribute to the Country Partnership Framework (FY24) which is to be
informed by the social dimensions of cohesion and resilience.


Analyze social dimensions of climate change and fragility in order to
support the government to define and implement just and inclusive
climate-resilient development programs for the South. The grant supports
analytic work on the nexus between climate change and social exclusion,
which contribute to the Country Climate and Development Report and
inform how development goals and programs for the South can be best
achieved in the context of fragility.


Estimate the economic and social costs and risks of the ongoing conflict
in the North of Mozambique to enhance prevention efforts and to
strengthen dialogue with the Government and with key partners. The grant
seeks to estimate the socio-economic costs of the conflict on affected
households, identify which potential risk factors at the level of households
and communities may contribute to the persistence and/or further spread
of violence and instability, and disseminate the findings to the Ministry
of Economy and Finance, development partners, and other stakeholders
across the humanitarian-development-peace nexus that are operating in
the north.


Provide analytics and recommendations on how to support improved PFM
transparency and accountability; and strengthen fiscal decentralization
for improved service delivery. The grant contributes to building and
consolidating peace by enhancing the government’s stewardship of public
resources and thereby building trust and establishing a more constructive
social contract with its citizens.

the way that the World Bank approaches the identification of resilience in
diagnostics such as Risk and Resilience Assessments (RRAs), Systematic
Country Diagnostics and other analytics; and recommendations for
informing its operationalization.


Pilot insect production and processing for increased resilience for forcibly
displaced and host communities in Chad, Mexico, and Uganda. The pilot
program focuses on forcibly displaced women and youth by helping them
produce, process, and market micro livestock, or insects, for human food,
animal feed, and fertilizers (IF4FFF). The improved economic resilience
from insect farming will provide income, livelihoods, and food security for
forcibly displaced populations and support reducing the negative spillovers
from FCV and help these communities recover, thereby mitigating the risk
of future violence.


Contribute to a better understanding of justice-related drivers of fragility
and conflict through the preparation of an RRA Guidance Note that
standardizes the way in which justice and rule of law issues are addressed
in future RRAs, ultimately contributing to a more systematized inclusion of
justice issues into country-level planning and operations.


Support the establishment of a strategic framework and identify effective
approaches for social protection engagement, including but not limited
to adaptive social protection, in FCV-affected countries. A Social
Protection and Jobs Approach Paper will be produced to guide strategic
and operational engagement in FCV settings with an aim to balance
addressing immediate needs with contributing to state and peacebuilding
for long-term development.
