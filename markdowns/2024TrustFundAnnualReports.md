**Image Description:**
The image shows a man in a field, actively engaged in an agricultural activity. He is wearing a long-sleeved gray shirt, dark pants, and a gray camouflage hat. The man is holding a woven basket or tray at an angle, through which grains or seeds are falling, likely as part of a winnowing process. The background features a lush green field with tall grass or crops, some trees, and a partly cloudy sky. The scene suggests farming or harvesting work in a rural setting.

There is no visible text in the image. The layout focuses closely on the man, capturing his action and expression, with the grain falling prominently in the foreground against the natural outdoor background. This image is likely used to illustrate agricultural work or rural development in the annual development report.

Resilience and FCV
TF0C2141
Fill knowledge gaps on resilience in FCV contexts and develop a more 
systematic approach for supporting resilience in World Bank diagnostics 
and operations. This will be achieved by exploring themes and key 
questions related to the three aspects of resilience, ranging from the more 
structural conceptualization of it to, more practically, what this means for 
the way that the World Bank approaches the identification of resilience in 
diagnostics such as Risk and Resilience Assessments (RRAs), Systematic 
Country Diagnostics and other analytics; and recommendations for 
informing its operationalization.

Insect farming for 
forcibly displaced
TF0C3140; RETF grant 
pending
Pilot insect production and processing for increased resilience for forcibly 
displaced and host communities in Chad, Mexico, and Uganda. The pilot 
program focuses on forcibly displaced women and youth by helping them 
produce, process, and market micro livestock, or insects, for human food, 
animal feed, and fertilizers (IF4FFF). The improved economic resilience 
from insect farming will provide income, livelihoods, and food security for 
forcibly displaced populations and support reducing the negative spillovers 
from FCV and help these communities recover, thereby mitigating the risk 
of future violence.
