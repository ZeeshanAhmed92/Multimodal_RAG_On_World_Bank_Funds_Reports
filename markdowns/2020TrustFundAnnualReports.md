EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report updates progress on the Jobs Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF)-funded activities from 
December 2019 to December 2020:
•	 It summarizes recent WBG efforts to address jobs challenges in client countries that the work 
of the Jobs MDTF complements. 
•	 Further, it presents the core achievements of the Jobs MDTF since its inception and outlines 
the updated strategy for the next Phase II of the fund (2021–2025), as discussed and agreed 
upon with the WBG’s Jobs Steering Committee (JSC) and donor partners in 2019/2020. 
•	 Finally, the report presents progress of active grants between January 1st and December 31st, 
2020 – including the ways that the MDTF has supported the response to the COVID-19 crisis 
– and provides updated financial statements for the MDTF to the end of 2020.
Established in 2014, the Jobs Umbrella Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) supports: 
(i)	
Design and implementation of jobs strategies for World Bank Group (WBG) client countries. 
(ii)	 Advancement of global knowledge on effective policies and activities for sustainable jobs, 
especially for the most vulnerable groups. 
The MDTF is administered by the Jobs Group, a cross-cutting unit seated in the Social Protection 
and Jobs (SPJ) Global Practice (GP) and governed by the WBG-wide JSC.
The MDTF began operations in March 2015 and brought together all WBG trust-funded 
activities on the Jobs agenda under a single umbrella. Its high-level objectives are (i) to support 
WBG client countries in designing high-impact jobs strategies, and (ii) to advance global knowledge 
on effective jobs policies, especially for vulnerable groups. Funds are allocated across five operational 
windows on Jobs Diagnostics and Strategies; Support to Private Sector; Jobs Solutions for Youth; 
Jobs Support in Fragile, Conflict, and Violence (FCV) countries; and Robust Research on Jobs. The 
MDTF awarded 115 grants in 44 countries and 6 regions, valued at US$44.5 million.
Through grants funded through these windows, the MDTF delivered a wide range of outputs. 
These include research studies, data sets, policy notes, empirical tools for jobs estimation and 
technical assistance that leveraged jobs lending operations. The MDTF contributed to results on key 
outcomes summarized below and discussed in detail in this report. More information is available in 
the 2018 and 2019 Jobs MDTF Annual Reports.
The MDTF has improved jobs policy and program design and strengthened policy dialogue on 
jobs among development partners. MDTF grants across different sectors and themes analyzed 
jobs issues and provided recommendations directly integrated into project operations.
Further, the MDTF has supported better integration of the private sector in framing job 
creation and job challenges and solutions. Providing support to the private sector is key to

increasing economic growth and employment opportunities in developing countries. MDTF’s 
Let’s Work partnership has spearheaded support for private sector development.
The MDTF has leveraged a new generation of jobs lending operations. These explicitly focus 
on jobs outcomes, such as jobs creation in the formal sector, improving the quality of informal jobs, 
and connecting vulnerable groups to jobs.
The MDTF has built country stakeholders’ capacity to design and implement jobs policies and 
programs. In just one example, a grant in Ecuador built institutional capacity to create comprehensive 
labor market statistics and foster institutional dialogue by (i) designing and implementing a labor 
demand module for the comprehensive industrial survey; (ii) integrating the labor ministry’s registry 
into the Laboratory for Labor and Business Dynamics data system; (iii) merging industrial surveys 
with that system; and (iv) creating labor demand statistics using data mining.
The MDTF has developed a set of tools, guidance, and methodologies that will strengthen 
jobs analytics and program design. Standardized Job Diagnostics (JDs) were created under 
IDA17 and have taken off across the Bank, with well over 30 countries now having completed or 
started a JD.
The MDTF has strengthened the evidence base on jobs challenges and solutions. This includes 
improved data and/or access to data through new collection, compilation, and dissemination. The 
MDTF co-financed “Haitian Cities—Actions for Today with an Eye on Tomorrow,” which looked at 
the challenges of rapid urbanization in places with high exposure to natural disasters and their 
implications for access to jobs and connectivity.
The MDTF has facilitated knowledge sharing among jobs practitioners and partnerships. 
This includes access to web-based knowledge platforms to support client service delivery. It also 
includes improving knowledge flows, coordinating, and establishing Job Practitioners knowledge 
networks for regular structured knowledge exchange, and holding dissemination events. MDTF 
supported launch of the new website portal for all partnerships and associated knowledge under 
the aegis of the Jobs Group.
Strong, positive WBG-wide response has validated the new Supporting Effective Jobs Lending 
at Scale (SEJLS) approach. Along with the positive response across the WBG, there has been 
wide recognition that such coordination is much needed.
The WBG and develop partners need more rigorous definition and measurement of jobs 
projects outcomes and impacts. Difficulties in accurately measuring jobs results have been a 
barrier to developing effective jobs-focused projects. 
Processes for jobs estimation and results reporting require harmonization and standardization, 
as confirmed during COVID-19 by the large costs associated with lack of coordination. The 
global approach to jobs measurement has been fragmented and inefficient, with different actors 
making uncoordinated progress.
Increased emphasis on outreach, awareness-raising, and consultations is needed. Excellent 
technical outputs, products and reports are necessary, but they may not always be enough to ensure 
stakeholder buy-in, application and use.

Countries display considerable unmet demand for training and capacity building for job 
diagnostics and strategies. Training is more effective when targeted to an appropriate technical 
audience, conducted in a joint team of government and donor representatives, and based on specific 
national data from the country in question. Training has proved to be an effective approach to convey 
solutions.
COVID-19 pandemic labor market disruptions have exacerbated jobs challenges, emphasizing 
the need for innovative solutions and an increased private sector involvement. In developing 
countries, the private sector provides 90 percent of jobs, which are much more negatively affected 
by crises than are public sector jobs.
The cross-cutting nature of the Jobs MDTF has been instrumental in supporting new activities 
and coordinating COVID-19 responses. A JSC, formed by Global Directors across the WBG, is 
the governance mechanism for the Jobs MDTF, advised by the JSC Technical Working Group. Over 
the reporting period, the JSC met regularly to manage allocation of Jobs-MDTF resources and to 
discuss progress on underlining activities.
With the agreement of donors and the JSC, in 2020 the Jobs MDTF extended its planning 
horizon to a second phase (Phase II, 2021–2025) and agreed to raise an additional 
US$53 million. The additional funding would complete the US$100 million funding goal originally 
agreed between the World Bank and donors. The renewed Jobs MDTF strategy confirms the original 
objectives of the fund and strengthens support to large-scale operationalization of the jobs agenda, 
while continuing to support innovative work to address knowledge gaps.
During Phase II, the Jobs MDTF will be restructured into three operational windows: 
(1)	 Jobs Lending at Scale: Will provide resources to task teams to help scale-up the WBG’s 
jobs lending portfolio across sectors and regions. Key objectives will be: (i) improve technical 
capacity of operations to improve targeting of jobs outcome in key sectors; (ii) scale-up 
operational approaches targeting jobs outcomes, especially in low-income and fragile settings; 
and (iii) standardize operational approaches to jobs challenges in client countries and frame a 
WBG-wide integrated jobs strategy.
(2)	 Measurement: This window will enable evidence-based jobs initiatives. Key objectives will 
be: (i) upgrade country-level data and diagnostics on jobs outcomes to enable evidence-based 
jobs initiatives; and (ii) advance the technical capacity for measuring jobs outcomes to provide 
policymakers with improved information on expected benefits of interventions.
(3)	 Partnership and Innovation: This window will support engagement and dissemination 
outreach between the Jobs Group and key stakeholders. Key objectives will be: (i) influence 
non-WBG jobs strategies by convening key stakeholders to learn from MDTF outputs; and (ii) 
identify and accelerate cutting-edge solutions to emerging jobs challenges, and scaling them 
through WBG operations.

2020 PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS
JOIN is a Global Jobs Indicator Data Bank—a standardized repository of key labor market 
indicators—for WB staff and policymakers. The WB Jobs Group launched JOIN in 2019 and 
updated it in 2020. After the latest update, the current version of JOIN uses 2,185 surveys totaling 
about 228 million observations. The surveys are drawn from a dedicated and standardized World Bank 
survey compilation focusing on labor indicators, called the International Income Distribution Data 
Set (I2D2). Additionally, in 2020 the team launched a new Microsoft Excel-based JOIN benchmarking 
tool giving users more options to customize analysis.
The Supporting Effective Jobs Lending (SEJLS) program started implementing activities 
across its “champion projects.” SEJLS responds to the need to better define and measure 
outcomes and benefits of jobs relevant policies and programs; as such, it focuses on leveraging 
large‑scale WBG lending operations and improving design consistency of their jobs-relevant 
components and estimation of jobs outcomes. of SEJLS incorporated 15 “champion projects” 
representing strategic and jobs-relevant WBG business lines into its first round, and began 
implementation of project activities. Many of these projects had to adapt their focus to address 
emerging COVID-19 pandemic challenges.
The Solutions for Youth Employment (S4YE) team further scaled-up S4YE activities across 
all pillars of the work program. A full-fledged S4YE Knowledge Repository for Youth Employment 
Practitioners, created and launched in 2019, hosts WBG as well as S4YE partner-developed tools. 
S4YE launched a new “How-to Series” to provide a quick step-by-step guide in 1–2 pages for 
practitioners and policymakers designing new youth employment programs. The team published 
two How-to Notes in 2020 in partnership with the World Bank’s Mexico Youth Labor Market Inclusion 
(MYLMI) project. The S4YE team continued to build and deepen partnerships. In an effort to 
strengthen partnership with private sector, S4YE launched a series of monthly webinars highlighting 
the work of a private sector partner each month, bring insights and lessons to WBG teams.
In Mozambique, the Jobs Group continued its engagement. Through the Let’s Work Partnership 
Country Pilot, the Jobs Group Jobs Strategy Note integrated recommended policy and program 
actions from the Let’s Work program’s activities. The MDTF also supported the Improving Jobs 
of Smallholder Women Farmers grant in Mozambique funding the design and implementation of 
two training interventions targeted at female farmers in the context of a feeder road rehabilitation 
program led by a World Bank (WB) operation in Tete province, Mozambique.
In Liberia, the Youth Opportunities Impact Evaluation (IE) Grant addresses key questions 
on how to cost-effectively promote self-employment and entrepreneurship in fragile and 
conflict-affected states. Preliminary results indicate that self-employment, financial inclusion, and 
ownership of business assets increased among beneficiaries in treatment groups compared to the 
control group.
In Nepal, the Jobs Platform supports delivery of better jobs outcomes, both in the formal and 
the informal sector, especially for low-income workers and excluded groups. In 2020, the team 
published an small and medium enterprise (SME) study, “Market Study to Understand Job Growth 
Potential in SMEs in Nepal,” which was central to the labor demand analysis in the Jobs Diagnostic. 
The second main outcome is improved alignment of the Nepal lending portfolio with jobs objectives.

This was achieved through an assessment of the current portfolio mapping the World Bank (WB) 
against the three-pillar Jobs Conceptual Framework (JCF) for monitoring creation of more, better, 
and more inclusive jobs.
In Mexico, the Youth Labor Market Inclusion grant designs, pilots, and evaluates innovative 
approaches to improve employment outcomes for low-income youth graduates. The 
beneficiaries are graduates from upper secondary education and transitioning into the labor market. 
Early IE results show that formal employment incentives (FEI) improve the probability of graduates 
being formally employed in the short-term, and increase job stability and access to the formal 
labor market.
NEXT STEPS
Initiate the Jobs MDTF’s Phase II implementation during the 2021–2025 period. Responding to 
the ambition of IDA donors and governments, during Phase II, the MDTF will focus on supporting 
large-scale operationalization of the jobs agenda, while continuing to support an innovative work 
program to address knowledge gaps.
Continue to implement the SEJLS program and invest in understanding jobs outcomes 
through data and analytics. The MDTF will continue to strengthen the design consistency of 
jobs-relevant project components and estimation of jobs outcomes. 
Promote exchange of best practices and lessons from MDTF outputs and tools to help build 
development partners’ capacity. Beyond the WBG, it is crucial to reinforce the broader discussion 
on improving jobs outcomes with development partners and government and private sector actors. 
An important Jobs Group and Jobs MDTF role is to support dialogue between government agencies 
charged with addressing the jobs agenda—such as job creation commissions, competitiveness 
councils, and national training agencies—and leverage private sector involvement to identify 
opportunities for, and constraints to, accelerated job creation.
Maximizing linkages to the Jobs and Economic Transformation (JET) theme, focusing on the 
poorest countries. Successful transformation means responding to evolving technology and skills 
demand while taking account of economies’ resource endowments and comparative advantages. 
The Jobs MDTF will play a key role in supporting JET operationalization during Phase II by improving 
conceptual framing of a growing pipeline of WBG projects addressing jobs. It will also support 
improved measurement of jobs effects by contributing to efforts to estimate indirect jobs effects 
from WBG operations.
Advance the Jobs-After-COVID workstream. Building on lessons learned through the JobsWatch 
initiative and other fund activities mobilized in response to COVID-19, the Jobs Umbrella MDTF will 
continue focusing on the medium-term prospects for accelerating jobs transitions in developing 
countries in the aftermath of the pandemic. This workstream will build on the recently launched 
Jobs-After-COVID call for proposals, which aims to identify and accelerate pioneering diagnosis of, 
and solutions to, post-pandemic jobs challenges.

THE JOBS MULTI-DONOR TRUST FUND (MDTF) 
PHASE I
Since the inception of the Jobs MDTF, its activities have contributed directly to shaping 
and implementing the jobs agenda across the World Bank Group (WBG), leveraging 
complementarities with various initiatives. The Jobs MDTF has delivered a wide range of outputs 
that include studies, data sets, policy notes, empirical tools for jobs estimation, and technical 
assistance leveraging World Bank jobs lending operations. (Annex 1 summarizes the cumulative 
progress of the fund grants and Annex 2 covers beneficiaries).1 The Jobs Umbrella MDTF’s work 
aims to support the Bank’s broader effort to prioritize the Jobs Agenda (see Box 1.1).
BOX 1.1 
PRIORITIZING THE JOBS AGENDA AT THE WBG
The global movement to end poverty and boost shared prosperity hinges in large part on the types 
of jobs people have. For many countries, increasing labor force participation rates and ensuring 
that workers have access to good quality jobs will continue to be a challenge for many years. In 
response to emerging global jobs challenges, in recent years the WBG has prioritized its engagement 
by launching initiatives that complement the work of the Jobs MDTF in supporting WBG clients’ 
progress on the Jobs Agenda.
Creating better jobs for more people is the ultimate objective of a significant share of WBG 
programs and interventions. Yet some initiatives merit particular consideration by virtue of their 
consequences on labor market and related development outcomes. Key WBG jobs initiatives, include 
the International Development Association’s Jobs and Economic Transformation (IDA JET) special 
theme, the Human Capital Project (HCP), as well as the increased focus on market and job creation 
under IFC’s 3.0 corporate strategy. 
The JET special theme was introduced during IDA18 replenishment in 2017. Following the IDA17 
Inclusive Growth theme, IDA participants asked the WBG to take a more targeted approach on the 
jobs economic transformation agenda through deliberate and coordinated interventions supporting 
structural transformation, private sector-led job creation, increased job quality, and better inclusion 
of women and youth. 
The JET approach starts with sound foundations that provide the incentives for private sector 
actors to invest, hire and grow. It includes macro-financial stability, strong institutions, a business 
environment that levels the playing field for all enterprises, access to enabling infrastructure services, 
1	 Previous Jobs MDTF Annual Reports also cover these issues extensively.

and a stable and inclusive financial sector. The JET approach emphasizes three primary channels 
for raising productivity: 
(i)	
Encouraging reallocation of resources towards more productive activities and diversification 
into new sectors and products with potential to create more and better jobs and create new 
markets. Sectors with high potential to contribute to transformation vary by country, but higher 
value-added agriculture and light manufacturing can contribute in many IDA countries.
(ii)	 Expanding access to larger markets through trade and urbanization and deepen linkages 
between firms to make such integration inclusive. 
(iii)	 Upgrading existing jobs and enterprises to be more productive, with an emphasis on adopting 
new technologies and strengthening worker skills. Raising productivity and earnings is the 
most important pathway out of poverty—it is how development is achieved. 
FIGURE 1.1
Expanding Productivity Channels to Create Better Jobs for More People
The Human Capital Project (HCP) launched in 2017 represents a global effort to accelerate 
more and better investments in people for greater equity and economic growth. Credible 
measurement of education and health outcomes raises the importance of human capital locally, 
nationally, and globally. Measurement spurs demand for policy interventions to build human 
capital in countries where governments are not doing enough. Good measurement is essential to 
developing research and analysis to inform the design of policies to improve human capital. With 
this goal in mind, the World Bank launched the human capital project in 2017, a program of advocacy, 
measurement, and analytical work to raise awareness and increase demand for interventions to 
build human capital. The project has three components: 
(i)	
A cross-country metric: The Human Capital Index (HCI). The HCI quantifies the contribution 
of health and education to the productivity of the next generation of workers. Countries can

use it to assess how much income they are foregoing because of human capital gaps, and 
how much faster they can turn these losses into gains if they act now.
(ii)	 Measurement and research to inform policy action. Within countries, measurement leads 
to insights into what works and where to target resources. It also increases policy makers’ 
awareness of the importance of investing in human capital, creating momentum for action. 
Globally, comprehensive measurement sheds light on the differences between countries, and 
spurs demand for investment in people.
(iii)	 Support for country strategies to accelerate investment in human capital. The HCP 
helps countries tackle the worst barriers to human capital development, using a “whole of 
government” approach.
The HCP helps create the political space for national leaders to prioritize transformational 
human capital investments. Ministers from close to 30 pilot countries presented early ideas on 
how to accelerate investments, followed by a rare opportunity for their staff to work across regions 
and sectors in person. The number of countries actively participating in the project has grown to over 
40 as of 2019. The objective is rapid progress towards a world in which all children arrive in school 
well-nourished and ready to learn, can expect to attain real learning in the classroom, and are able 
to enter the job market as healthy, skilled, and productive adults.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has enhanced its focus on the job-creating 
impacts of its funding. Specifically, IFC’s corporate strategy (IFC 3.0) focuses the institution on 
creating markets and mobilizing private capital, with increased support to countries where private 
capital flows are inadequate to address major development gaps, such as the need for more, better, 
and inclusive jobs (see Box 1.2).
IFC investments have begun to measure job creation outcomes, particularly direct and indirect 
jobs. Through its financial market investments and advisory services, IFC has focused on SMEs and 
on strengthening backward and forward linkages from its investments; the IFC 3.0 strategy further 
reinforces upstream, market-creating activities. The joint IFC-WB Country Private Sector Diagnostics 
(CPSD) workstream analyzes job-led growth potential across a range of economic sectors in which 
IFC invests, including (i) real sectors (manufacturing, agribusiness, and services), (ii) finance, and 
(iii) infrastructure. Further, the ability to assess development impact and market creation potential 
before the start of a project—achieved by the Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring 
(AIMM) system—has influenced IFC’s project selection and design and will lead to more projects 
that can create markets.

KEY IFC JOBS PROGRAMS
The joint IFC and International Labour Organization (ILO) Better Work program (www.betterwork.org) 
aims to improve working conditions in garment factories. Better Work trains local enterprise 
advisors to assist factories comply with national labor laws and international standards through 
unannounced assessment, and advisory and training services. Since its inception, Better Work 
has undertaken activities in nine countries, with eight countries having established programs 
(Cambodia, Haiti, Jordan, Lesotho, Indonesia, Vietnam, Nicaragua, and Bangladesh). The program 
has three components:
(i)	
Compliance Assessment Activities in factories: auditors evaluate if the factories are adhering 
to ILO Core Labor Standards and national labor laws.
(ii)	 Continuous Improvement: Better Work staff facilitates dialogue between managers and 
workers to address their report’s findings and submits regular progress reports.
(iii)	 Stakeholder engagement: buy-in for the program and activities occurs at all levels, including 
government, employers, unions and workers, and international buyers.
The program is run by the ILO with IFC being part of the management team providing both 
investment services and discrete advisory initiatives. One such program is Gender Equality and 
Returns (GEAR ) for the Manufacturing sector. GEAR unlocks career progression opportunities for 
female sewing operators through training to advance into supervisory roles, with training including 
a mix of technical, managerial, team building, and “soft” skills.
IFC’s GenderSmart Business Solutions provide clients with the tools and resources to 
strengthen gender inclusion within their operations, resolve labor issues, increase employee 
engagement and enhance company performance. IFC is an established and leading partner for 
global private sector entities proving the business case for inclusive jobs through gender equality, 
with programs such as the SheWorks Global Partnership and Tackling Childcare.

SheWorks Global Partnership
Tackling Childcare
Led by IFC’s Gender Secretariat and 
supported with technical expertise from 
three strategic partners—including the 
EDGE Certified Foundation, ILO, and the 
UN Women’s Empowerment Principles—
SheWorks is a hands-on project focused 
on activating policies to advance women’s 
employment and promotion. SheWorks 
members represent a variety of regions and 
sectors and regularly share knowledge and 
best practices. Members are conducting 
firm-level gender assessments, instituting 
mentorship and sponsorship programs to 
foster women’s leadership, setting effective 
anti-sexual-harassment mechanisms, and 
providing flexible working arrangements.
IFC’s series of Tackling Childcare reports 
spanning Bangladesh, Cambodia, Fiji, India, 
Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and 
other countries demonstrate a strong business 
case for employers to meet employee 
childcare needs. IFC research shows that 
family-friendly workplace policies such as 
childcare, flexible work, and paid leave can 
enable firms to attract and retain talent and 
boost productivity and profits. To accelerate 
implementation and raise awareness, IFC 
recently led the Global Tackling Childcare 
Working Group of more than 30 organizations 
to share knowledge and develop guidance for 
employers, including the Guide for Employer-
Supported Childcare as well as Childcare in 
the COVID‑19 Era: A Guide for Employers.
CORE ACHIEVEMENTS
The Jobs MDTF began operations in March 2015 and brought together all the WBG trust-
funded activities on the Jobs agenda under a single umbrella. Its high-level objectives are to (i) 
support WBG client countries design high-impact jobs strategies, and (ii) advance global knowledge 
on effective jobs policies, especially for vulnerable groups. Funds are allocated across five operational 
windows: Jobs Diagnostics and Strategies, Support to Private Sector, Jobs Solutions for Youth, Jobs 
Support in Fragile, Conflict and Violence (FCV) countries, and Robust Research on Jobs. The MDTF 
awarded 115 grants in 44 countries and six regions valued at US$44.5 million.
Grants helped deliver a wide range of outputs including research studies, data sets, policy notes, 
empirical tools for jobs estimation, and technical assistance on World Bank jobs lending operations. 
MDTF contributed to results on seven jobs outcomes, some of which are highlighted here. (More 
details are available in the 2018 and 2019 Jobs MDTF Annual Reports). 
Outcome 1: Improved Coordination of Jobs Polices and Programs. 
The MDTF improved jobs policy and program design and strengthened the jobs policy dialogue 
among development partners. MDTF grants across different sectors and themes analyzed Jobs 
issues and provided recommendations to directly integrate into project operations. Examples include:

•	 MDTF funded “Job Creation in the Private Sector: An Exploratory Assessment of Patterns and 
Determinants at the Macro, Sector, and Firm Levels” study showed that overall, more jobs 
are generated in economies where formal job creation is more responsive to growth cycles. 
Findings of this paper are being implemented in Bangladesh through Jobs Development Policy 
Operations (DPOs), which support broad-based policy reforms in the country. 
•	 The Jobs MDTF also supported the “Exports to Jobs: Boosting the Gains from Trade in South 
Asia” study estimating the potential impact from increasing South Asian trade on total and 
wage employment and earnings. The results suggest that providing incentives for increasing 
labor‑intensive production in tradable goods and services would result in more wage employment 
and less casual work. These findings highlight the potential of increased trade openness to 
address the jobs deficits facing South Asia. 
•	 The Jobs Group also developed Jobs Solutions Notes based on evidence drawn from research, 
impact evaluations, pilots, and operations. Jobs Group technical experts collaborated with other 
WB experts to author the Notes, which are succinct, actionable, and go beyond a literature 
review. While the methodology for each Note was similar—literature review, portfolio analysis, 
and consultations—the range of evidence and scale of application vary considerably.
Outcome 2: Mainstreaming the Private Sector in the Jobs Agenda. 
The MDTF has supported a stronger recognition of the private sector role in framing jobs challenges 
and solutions. Providing support to the private sector is key to increasing economic growth and 
employment opportunities in developing countries. The MDTF’s Let’s Work partnership spearheaded 
its support to private sector development:
•	 In Zambia, the Let’s Work Program analyzed poultry and aquaculture value chains and highlighted 
the potential to expand small-scale farmer income in the sector. The report concludes that 
policies to unlock job growth potential in the sector will need to focus on enabling more farmers 
to participate in commercial markets through increasing quantities and improving quality. 
•	 In Mozambique, the Let’s Work program studied the cassava, cashew, and plantation forestry 
value chains to understand the potential for inclusive private sector-led job creation integrating 
farmers into agribusiness. The team also developed a policy note highlighting challenges that 
need to be overcome to accelerate structural transformation in Mozambique. 
•	 Outside of the Let’s Work initiative, IFC’s Tackling Childcare grant built evidence on the business 
case for provision of gender-smart childcare services in the workplace. It also provided ideas on 
how the private sector can adopt such policies.
Outcome 3: Leveraging Innovative Operations for Job Creation. 
The MDTF has leveraged a new generation of World Bank jobs lending operations with an explicit 
focus on jobs outcomes, such as job creation in the formal sector, improving the quality of informal 
jobs, and connecting vulnerable groups to jobs. For example:
•	 In the Solomon Islands, the Training Women in SolTuna (TWIST) operation improved the 
employability of women in the tuna industry through demand-driven skills training and 
partnership with the private sector. An IFC investment client since 2013, SolTuna employs over 
1,800 workers, 64 percent of whom are women. Advisory work included a gender diagnostic,

qualitative and quantitative research, and interventions to understand and address root causes 
of absenteeism and turnover, and provision of financial literacy and other life-skills training to 
workers. 
•	 In Tunisia, a new, multi-sector youth jobs investment lending operation—approved based on 
inputs from the MDTF through the Let’s Work Tunisia country pilot)—supports integrated supply 
and demand-side interventions to improve jobs opportunities in lagging regions and marginalized 
peri-urban areas. On the supply side, the project addresses barriers (incentives, information, 
skills, and mobility) youth face in accessing jobs or moving to higher-quality jobs. On the demand 
side, the project provides matching grants and business support services, conditional on job 
creation, to existing and new enterprises in selected value chains. 
The MDTF has also supported operations to address policy constraints to better jobs outcomes. 
•	 In Jordan, the Jobs Group is leading the First Equitable Growth and Job Creation Development 
Policy Financing. This US$500 million policy-based lending operation helps Jordan lay the 
foundation for a higher and more sustainable economic growth path, while creating more jobs 
both for Jordanians and for non-Jordanian refugees and migrants. 
•	 In July 2019, following consultations with the Jobs MDTF donor partners and the JSC, the MDTF 
launched the Supporting Effective Jobs Lending at Scale (SEJLS) program. SEJLS responds to 
the need to better define and measure outcomes and impacts of jobs relevant policies and 
programs; as such, it focuses on leveraging large-scale WBG lending operations and improving 
design consistency of their jobs-relevant components and estimation of jobs outcomes. Fifteen 
champion projects representing strategic and jobs-relevant WBG business lines have been 
incorporated into the first round of SEJLS with funding of just over US$5 million. 
Outcome 4: Building Stakeholder Capacity. 
MDTF grants have helped build country stakeholders’ capacity to design and implement jobs policies 
and programs: 
•	 In Ecuador, an MDTF grant helped build institutional capacity to create comprehensive labor 
market statistics and foster institutional dialogue by (i) designing and implementing a labor 
demand module for the comprehensive industrial survey, (ii) integrating the labor ministry’s 
registry into the Laboratory for Labor and Business Dynamics data system, (ii) merging industrial 
surveys with that system, and (iv) creating labor demand statistics using data mining. 
•	 In Sierra Leone, an MDTF grant supported design and implementation of the 2016 Labor Force 
Survey (LFS) and production of an analytical report on jobs in Sierra Leone, relying on the 
2014 and 2016 LFS data. Support to the statistical agency included design, sampling, and a 
methodological approach for data collection of the 2016 LFS. 
•	 The Jobs Core Course learning event in 2018 and 2019 provided in-depth understanding of the 
conceptual and practical issues involved in the design and implementation of jobs strategies 
and interventions. The over 100 policy makers attending the event drew knowledge and lessons 
from many MDTF funded activities.

Outcome 5: Developing New Methods to Estimate Jobs Effects. 
The MDTF has developed a set of tools, guidance, and methodologies to strengthen jobs analytics 
and program design. 
•	 The use of Standardized Job Diagnostics (JDs), created under IDA17, have proliferated across 
the World Bank, with well over 30 countries now having completed or started a JD. 
•	 The MDTF-funded Jobs M&E Toolkit provides a package of resources for project teams to support 
mainstreaming the Jobs Agenda in WBG lending operations. It provides guidance on results 
indicators and simple tools for jobs data collection without the burden of resource‑intensive 
survey efforts. 
•	 The MDTF-funded COVID-19 JobsWatch initiative helped inform labor market policy responses 
during the crisis as it evolves and to prepare for recovery. The development objective is to 
synthesize and generate new evidence on COVID-19 labor market effects on workers, 
households, and firm, and to track policy responses to the economic crisis.2 
Outcome 6: Improved Evidence and Knowledge Base on Jobs. 
The MDTF has strengthened the evidence base on jobs challenges and solutions, included improving 
data and/or access to data through new collection, compilation, and dissemination. 
•	 In Haiti, the MDTF co-financed “Haitian Cities—Actions for Today with an Eye on Tomorrow” 
looked at the challenges rapid urbanization poses in places with high exposure to natural 
disasters and their implications for access to jobs and connectivity. The study used an innovative 
methodology – using on cell-phone call records to identify job and home locations of residents 
of Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haïtien—to assess commuting challenges and barriers to accessing 
opportunities in Haitian cities. The study received the World Bank President’s 2018 Award for 
Excellence in the category of Disruptive Technologies. 
•	 In Kenya, an MDTF grant assessed a common concern that directly helping small businesses 
to grow comes at the expense of unassisted competitors. Using a two-stage randomized 
experiment, the study found no evidence of negative spillovers on competing businesses, and 
the markets appear to have grown in terms of number of customers and sales volumes. 
•	 In Turkey, another MDTF grant examined the quality of management practices and its relation to 
other firm-level characteristics such as firm performance, competition, and type of ownership. 
The study found that management quality correlates with productivity and quality of jobs across 
manufacturing subsectors. The study also concluded that factors such as firm size, level of 
human capital of the workforce, export intensity of the firm, openness to international markets, 
level of hierarchy in decision making, and degree of managerial autonomy are important 
determinants of managerial practices. 
Outcome 7: Improved Knowledge Sharing and Leveraging. 
The MDTF has facilitated knowledge sharing among jobs practitioners and partnerships. This 
includes access to web-based knowledge platforms to support client service delivery. It also includes 
2	 Early findings from JobsWatch suggest that 34 percent of respondents reported stopping work, 20 percent of 
wage workers reported lack of payment for work performed, 9 percent reported job changes due to the pandemic, 
and 62 percent reported income loss in their household.

improving knowledge flows, coordinating and establishing Job Practitioners knowledge networks 
for regular structured knowledge exchange and holding dissemination events. The MDTF-supported 
launch of the new website portal for all Jobs Group partnerships and associated knowledge provides 
a single access point for the Jobs Umbrella MDTF, the LWP, the Solutions for Youth Employment 
(S4YE) partnership, and the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development. The 
resources section of each subsite allows access to a significant repository of knowledge, research, 
analysis, and tools. Jobs Data Visualization App allows users to customize charts and explore jobs 
indicators. It is based on the Global Micro Database to Track the Labor Market Outcomes of the 
Poor (the International Income Distribution Database), for which the MDTF grant contributed to jobs 
analytical work by adding variables on migration and second jobs in all 1,300 database surveys. The 
Jobs Group also launched JOIN—a Global Jobs Indicator Data Bank, a standardized repository of 
key labor market indicators for WB staff and policymakers. JOIN supports (i) regional jobs reports 
with time series trends based on WB microdata; (ii) better incorporation of information from WB 
microdata, such as household income and expenditure surveys in the Global Monitoring Database, 
WB Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS), and Labor Force Surveys; and (iii) Adding jobs 
indicators into the Development Economics (DEC) data repository for broader use. 
KEY LESSONS LEARNED
The activities and projects implemented over the Jobs MDTF’s first phase (2015–2020) contributed 
to a large body of knowledge beyond outputs produced. They highlight strengths and weaknesses in 
project or program preparation, design, and implementation that affect performance, outcome, and 
impact. Some key lessons learned from the Jobs MDTF so far are summarized here, emphasizing 
strategic implications for the MDTF’s second phase.
WBG strong positive response validated the new Supporting Effective Jobs Lending at 
Scale (SEJLS) approach. Strong response across the WBG to the SEJLS approach includes wide 
recognition that such coordination is much needed. The SELJS selection approach for “champion 
projects”—consisting in working directly with GPs and IFC leadership rather than through a WBG 
Intranet-wide “call for proposals”—has proven effective in targeting projects reflecting important 
WBG business lines that influence jobs outcomes in client countries.
The World Bank and its development partners need more rigorous definition and 
measurement of jobs project outcomes and effects. Difficulties in accurately measuring jobs 
results have been a barrier to developing effective jobs-focused projects. To capture the development 
benefits of jobs‑relevant interventions and to estimate economy-wide effects, it is necessary to 
go beyond estimating direct jobs created to include indirect jobs (that is, jobs created in suppliers 
and distributors) and induced jobs (such as jobs from business expansions made possible by 
infrastructure investments and policy reforms).
Processes for jobs estimation and results reporting need to be harmonized and standardized, 
as confirmed during COVID-19 pandemic. The fragmented global approach to jobs measurement 
during the COVID-19 pandemic has been inefficient, with different actors—development finance 
institutions, international organizations, nonprofits, and practitioners—making uncoordinated 
progress. Strengthening understanding of economy-wide effects from jobs strategies and

interventions, including through better development impact measurement and monitoring, 
represents a global public good. 
Increased emphasis on outreach, awareness-raising, and consultations is needed. Excellent 
technical outputs, products, and reports are necessary, but may not always be enough to ensure 
stakeholder buy-in and that they will apply findings. This underlines the importance of outreach, 
awareness-raising, and consultations, in addition to grant support. More investment is needed in 
dialogue, coordination, communication, and knowledge sharing among client representatives as 
well as WBG staff and donors at all levels: policy, project design, and measurement.  
World Bank client countries have considerable unmet demand for training and capacity 
building to conduct job diagnostics and strategies. Training is more effective when targeted to an 
appropriate technical audience; conducted in a joint team of government and donor representatives; 
and based on specific national country data. Training has proved to be an effective approach to 
convey solutions.
COVID-19 labor market disruptions exacerbated jobs challenges, emphasizing the need for 
innovative solutions and increased private sector involvement. The private sector in developing 
countries create 90 percent of jobs, and these jobs are much more affected by a crisis such as 
a pandemic than are public sector jobs. Developing countries urgently need special attention to 
private sector job creation and protection, especially micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). 
All categories of workers require support, but some groups have been hit particularly hard by the 
pandemic, such as women, particularly due to the service sector downturn. Young people are also 
very negatively affected; more than four in ten young people employed globally worked in hard-
hit sectors when the crisis began. These jobs challenges are especially severe in IDA countries, 
combining daunting pre-COVID unemployment and informality rates with limited financial capacity 
to support recovery plans.
The cross-cutting nature of the Jobs MDTF has been instrumental in supporting new activities 
and coordinating COVID-19 responses. The Jobs Steering Committee (JSC), formed by Global 
Directors across the WBG, is the governance mechanism for the Jobs MDTF, advised by the JSC 
Technical Working Group. Over the reporting period, the JSC met regularly to manage allocation of 
Jobs MDTF resources and to discuss progress on underlining activities. Beyond administration of 
the Jobs MDTF portfolio, an important JSC function is to coordinate jobs responses across WBG 
sectoral interventions. In the context of the selection and review of SEJLS champion projects, JSC 
members convened and discussed the best operational avenues to tackle jobs challenges. When 
the Covid crisis occurred, the JSC provided a forum for discussion, feedback, and coordination of 
the several sectoral responses initiated in response to the emergency.

THE JOBS MDTF PHASE II
OBJECTIVES
While there was already significant demand in WBG countries for support on jobs programs, 
COVID-19 has cast a sharp light on the importance of enacting effective jobs strategies. 
The pandemic represents an opportunity to address some obstacles to better jobs outcomes, 
although pandemic employment effects depend on policy responses, which could lead to severe 
and long-lasting negative effects if policies are not timely or effective. In this context, improving our 
understanding of jobs outcomes and of what programs benefit people remains a priority.
At the same time, pandemic disruptions and the speed with which the crisis has unfolded 
have created new measurement challenges. Measurement methods and sources normally used 
to track labor market outcomes showed significant shortcomings. Furthermore, social distancing 
and other disease transmission prevention measures have affected several data-related activities 
around the world degrading data availability, quality, and reliability.3 
The JSC and its donors agreed in 2020 to extend the MDTF planning horizon to a second 
Phase (Phase II, 2021–2025) and agreed to raise an additional US$53 million. This completes 
the US$100 million funding goal originally agreed between the World Bank and donors. A strategy 
document for the next Phase II was discussed and agreed with the JSC (September 17th, 2020) 
and donors (September 30th, 2020). 
The Phase II strategy document maintains the two original objectives of the Jobs MDTF:
(i)	
To support the design and implementation of comprehensive, integrated, and high-impact jobs 
strategies for WBG client countries.
(ii)	 To advance global knowledge on the most effective policies and activities for sustainable jobs, 
especially for the most vulnerable groups.
However, there are important shifts in emphasis: The Phase II strategy will focus on supporting 
large-scale operationalization of the jobs agenda while continuing to support innovative work 
to address knowledge gaps. During Phase II, the MDTF will also increase outreach efforts to 
maximize learning from implementation of its activities. Beyond the objectives of each workstream, 
it will reflect the following overarching principles: 
•	 Be an integrated, cross-cutting facility, focused on activities that might not be prioritized by 
other funding streams.
•	 Establish a medium-term jobs agenda for developing countries (LICs and MICs) that reflects 
and internalizes the multiple impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

•	 Take account of the private sector development potential of jobs-relevant operations and 
create incentives for private sector investors to replicate and scale such investments.
•	 Focus on closing gender gaps in jobs outcomes, such as labor force participation, employment, 
and earnings.
•	 Support access to jobs for vulnerable groups, with strong attention to youth, fragility, minority 
groups, and people with disabilities. 
•	 Ensure coherent linkages with related WBG strategic priorities, including:
	›
Operationalization of the 2019 WDR on The Changing Nature of Work and the WBG strategy 
for FCV 2020–2025.
	›
Implementation of the IDA19 JET Special Theme and the WBG Gender Strategy’s jobs pillar.
	›
Related WBG and donor community agendas, including the Human Capital Project (HCP), 
Universal Social Protection 2030, and the Africa “digital moonshot” agenda.
•	 Generating solutions relevant across geographical regions and country contexts by reflecting 
the different nature of jobs challenges experienced.
PROGRAM COMPONENTS
The MDTF began operation in March 2015, bringing together all WBG trust-funded activities on the 
jobs agenda under a single umbrella. The fund originally allocated resources across five operational 
windows: 
•	 Window 1: Jobs Diagnostics, Strategies and Operations—develop and implement jobs 
strategies for specific country challenges, building on the deliverables of the other windows.
•	 Window 2: Job Creation through the Private Sector (Let’s Work Partnership, or LWP)—
support private-sector-led job growth, building on country pilots and measurement work. 
•	 Window 3: Jobs and Youth—build jobs solutions for young people and strengthen the global 
knowledge base on youth employment.
•	 Window 4: Jobs in Fragile, Conflict, and Violence (FCV) Situations—support employment 
generation through diagnostics, innovative interventions, and international partner coordination.
•	 Window 5: Actionable and Robust Research—in partnership with the International Labor 
Organization (ILO) and the World Bank Development Economics Vice Presidency, implement 
rigorous research focusing on key policy questions to support the other windows. 
During Phase II, the Jobs MDTF will be restructured into 3 operational windows, as described below 
(Figure 2.1).

Expanding Productivity Channels to Create Better Jobs for More People
Window 1—Jobs Lending at Scale 
This window will provide resources to task teams to help scale the WBG’s jobs lending 
portfolio across sectors and regions. Key objectives will be: (i) improve the technical quality of 
operations to improve targeting of jobs outcome in key sectors; (ii) scale-up operational approaches 
targeting jobs outcomes, especially in low-income and fragile settings; and (iii) standardize 
operational approaches to jobs challenges in client countries and frame a WBG-wide integrated 
jobs strategy.
It is increasingly important for the WBG and donor community to show a development 
benefit and “value for money” by measuring how investments contribute to jobs and 
earnings outcomes. Through joint engagement of the Jobs Group with WBG operational teams, 
and by validating lending intervention models across sectors, this approach is expected to inform 
development of good quality, context-specific jobs strategies and operations.
The Jobs MDTF funds will strengthen consistency of jobs-relevant project and components 
design and jobs outcomes estimation in Results Frameworks. Targeted jobs indicators will 
vary across project types, but could include direct, indirect, and induced effects on the quantity and 
quality of jobs and indicators by beneficiary characteristics (males/females disaggregated by age, 
education, location, ethnicity/race, disability, and other relevant characteristics). 
Window 1 will build on the SEJLS pilot.4 The launch of the SEJLS program has generated 
great interest among WBG operational units. GP, CCSA, and IFC leaders represented in the JSC 
have supported the view that the SEJLS program represents an opportunity to efficiently scale 
the WBG’s jobs strategy by leveraging existing and planned large-scale operations. Beyond scale, 
there is also agreement that the SEJLS program will help establish stronger operation project 
design and impact evaluation standards in GPs, which improves the consistency of WBG jobs-
lending strategies. Additionally, the Jobs Group has held initial discussion on the project with the 
EU and the ILO.

## Page 33
Window 1 will also incorporate key IFC operations not part of the SEJLS pilot. In past years, 
IFC has strengthened the jobs focus of selected investment and advisory programs. Broadening 
the scope of this work can have tremendous benefits on leveraging the jobs potential of private 
sector investment.
Window 1 aims to establish and enforce technical standards for jobs-relevant projects to 
ensure a consistent, systematic, and intentional approach to jobs outcomes across GPs. 
This will produce a new generation of operations featuring improved design, consisting of three 
key elements: 
(i)	
Projects supported under Window 1 will incorporate the expected benefits on jobs outcomes 
in their underlining theory of change (ToC). The narrative of the project objectives should 
explain causal links between the operation’s activities, outputs, intermediate outcomes, and 
longer-term outcomes and the benefits expected to occur beyond project’s closing. The ToC 
should identify indicators to measure progress on achievement of outcomes. 
(ii)	 Projects will build on an economic analysis estimating return to public investment and 
analyzing the distribution of gains. This analysis will incorporate the following elements:
	›
Specify market failures the investment addresses. GPs typically address different market 
failures, such as capital market failures, coordination failures, natural monopolies in network 
services, externalities in education/training, among other things. The analysis should explain 
how the investment aims to correct market failures.
	›
Estimate social gains. The analysis should attempt to quantify projected earnings gains that 
might arise from job creation or productivity growth linked to the project’s implementation. 
Job creation, job quality, job access, and intermediate benefits such as human capital 
investments are relevant jobs outcomes. Income gains to workers represent a labor 
externality that should be included in the analysis.
	›
Specify distribution of expected gains. The analysis should also specify the types of 
workers who receive the social gains (segment of the labor force and their attributes).
	›
Identify jobs outcomes indicators. Projects will adopt them as part of their M&E framework. 
These will be key to monitor progress towards their stated jobs objectives. This will not only 
contribute to more effective jobs intervention, but also improve the quality and availability of 
operational data on jobs.
Window 1 will also inform specific project components or instruments with direct links 
to improving jobs outcomes in WBG operations. Across sectors and types of interventions, 
these activities will aim to maximize the potential benefits on jobs outcomes of associated WBG 
investments and to systematize related transmission channels. 
Window 2—Measurement 
This window will enable evidence-based jobs initiatives. Key objectives will be: (i) upgrade 
country-level data and diagnostics on jobs outcomes to enable evidence-based jobs initiatives, and 
(ii) advance the technical capacity for measurement of jobs outcomes to provide policymakers with 
improved information on the expected impact of their interventions.
T H E  J O B S  M D T F  P H A S E  I I
25


## Page 34
Window 2 will continue support the jobs knowledge and measurement agenda to provide 
policymakers with the tools they need to enact effective jobs initiatives. In particular, Window 2 
will achieve this by (i) making more and better jobs outcomes data available, (ii) undertaking 
diagnostics to prioritize action on binding jobs challenges, and (iii) promoting reliable measurement 
of economy-wide jobs effects. 
Accurately identifying the key job challenges an economy faces is the foundation of effective 
jobs strategies. Countries typically face multiple jobs challenges at the same time and, depending 
on the context, these may have different causes and constitute more or less binding issues. 
Such complexity calls for country-focused evidence about core jobs problem(s) countries face, 
and what might be causing them. In this context, the importance of solid diagnostics building on 
economy‑wide and—where available—regional data on jobs outcomes through national data sources 
cannot be overstated.
To promote deeper country jobs analysis, the Jobs Group has developed standardized country 
and region-specific Jobs Diagnostics with the support of the Jobs MDTF. Jobs diagnostics 
apply standard tools and techniques and follow a data-driven guided enquiry that considers whether 
jobs outcomes in the country are within normal ranges given the country’s growth and economic 
transformation. Jobs Diagnostics interpret detailed information about the path of economic 
transformation in a country, the changing profile of workers and jobs over time, returns to education, 
and probabilities of labor force participation and employment. They identify abnormal symptoms by 
benchmarking the country’s jobs outcomes over time against other similar countries at similar stages 
of development. Jobs Diagnostics increasingly feed into WBG Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs), 
Country Economic Memoranda (CEMs), and Poverty Assessments.
Beyond data and diagnostics, Window 2 will contribute to better measuring the effects of 
public policies, programs, and private investments on jobs outcomes. Projects that target direct 
job creation—that is, where jobs creation is a direct result of the project’s implementation—do 
not pose particular estimation challenges. However, such projects represent a minority of Bank 
interventions; for most WBG projects, the number of jobs directly associated with an investment 
will be small relative to the indirect effects through backward and forward linkages, or the catalytic 
effects of investing in infrastructure, the financial sector, education/skills, regulatory reform, or other 
enabling sectors. For example, investing in energy infrastructure creates direct employment through 
temporary construction jobs (and possibly new permanent jobs in generation and distribution), but 
it will create considerably more jobs from indirect and induced demand for labor. But all of these 
could be dwarfed by the number of dynamically-induced jobs that result from the transformational 
change that energy access has on investment and growth, such as increased productivity and 
improved access to markets.
Window 2 will expand IFC’s Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring (AIMM) to 
selected WBG operations. This will build on the initial collaboration with the IFC under SEJLS to 
pilot their approach to indirect jobs estimation in the context of jobs-relevant WBG operations. In 
particular, IFC’s current estimation framework assesses IFC investment projects and would need 
to expansion to a broad enough base of potential WBG interventions.

Window 3—Influence through Partnerships & Innovation 
This window will support a strong engagement and dissemination outreach between the 
Jobs Group and key stakeholders. Key objectives will be: (i) influence non-WBG jobs strategies by 
convening key stakeholders to learn from MDTF outputs, and (ii) identify and accelerate cutting‑edge 
solutions to emerging jobs challenges and scaling them through WBG operations.
A key goal of Window 3 is to support partnerships between the private sector and WBG 
operations. This will build on the experience of the Let’s Work and S4YE partnerships under Phase I 
of the MDTF. It will link strongly to the work of the IFC investment and advisory services operations 
and the private sector development work of the WBG in general, including the Country Private 
Sector Diagnostics (CPSD) workstream, led jointly by the Finance, Competitiveness and Innovation 
(FCI) GP and the IFC.
Window 3 will leverage IFC’s experience in unlocking private investment as the primary 
financier of the private sector at the WBG. IFC’s focus on more, better, and inclusive jobs across 
sectors can lead to opportunities to innovate new pilot programs and expand or scale-up those 
that have already demonstrated jobs results on the ground. The IFC 3.0 Creating Markets strategy 
will further reinforce upstream, market creating activities that seek to rescue, rebuild, and recover 
markets, especially in the context of COVID-19. Numerous opportunities exist to strengthen linkages 
with the private sector on jobs-focused investments and advisory engagements.
Window 3 will establish an “Innovation Challenge”, which will identify and accelerate 
pioneering diagnosis and solutions to jobs challenges. The focus will be on solutions that have 
already established “proof of concept” and are ready to scale. This will help the World Bank crowd-in 
cutting-edge innovative ideas and take them to scale. This workstream will require a high external 
engagement and working with a wide variety of stakeholders and partners.
The windows proposed under the new structure of the Jobs MDTF are mutually reinforcing, 
building on existing synergies between them. By improving assessments of jobs effects prior to 
projects, Window 1 will provide new evidence from operational projects—especially leveraging WB 
and IFC operations with the private sector—that can inform measurement work under Window 2. 
Additionally, since most WBG lending operations occur in client countries where data are scarce, 
outdated, incomplete, or otherwise not accessible, assessments of jobs effects before projects 
could improve data access or create demand for better country capacity to generate high-quality, 
timely data to monitor progress and inform policy. 
Window 1 projects can also benefit from measurement developments under Window 2. 
This is especially true given the Jobs Group’s role in supporting proposal development and grant 
implementation, and the renewed collaboration among GPs and the IFC established through SEJLS, 
which Phase II will maintain. This will draw on a variety of credible approaches to measurement, 
including impact evaluation studies as well as modelling approaches based in Input-Output tables, 
Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs), and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) techniques, and 
the IFC AIMM framework.
Finally, strengthening our understanding of economy-wide impacts of jobs strategies and 
interventions, including through better development impact measurement and monitoring, is

a public good. All the windows will help spark discussion with key stakeholders globally and could 
support other partners’ efforts to develop standardized and effective ways to estimate jobs impacts.
The five existing Phase I MDTF windows will continue to function until committed funds fully 
disburse. Following that, these workstreams will be integrated within the new three‑window structure.
Theory of change
To reflect refinements, an updated TOC, monitored through a revised results framework, will 
shape the Jobs MDTF during Phase II. Having discussed the channels of continuity between the 
Phase I and Phase II workstreams of the Jobs MDTF, Phase II objectives and structures adjust to
the needs of the upcoming work program. Figure 2.2 captures the program’s updated TOC, linking 
main activities to expected outputs, intermediate outcomes, as well as development outcomes. The 
structure reflects the three windows among which the activities will be distributed.

HIGHLIGHTS OF ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS
JOIN GLOBAL JOBS INDICATOR DATABASE 
Jobs are crucial for development, so a jobs-inclusive database was needed to support the 
design of public policies.5 JOIN is a Global Jobs Indicator Data Bank—a standardized repository 
of key labor market indicators—for WB staff and policymakers. The WB Jobs Group launched JOIN 
in 2019 and updated it in 2020. After the latest update, the current version of JOIN uses 2,185 
surveys totaling about 228 million observations. The surveys are drawn from a dedicated and 
standardized World Bank survey compilation focusing on labor indicators, called the International 
Income Distribution Data Set (I2D2). The surveys from 164 countries, of which 74 percent are low 
and middle-income countries. All household surveys have a labor module with about every fourth 
survey being a labor force survey (LFS) (27.3 percent). To ensure reliability, all surveys are subject to a 
data quality check. After filtering out surveys that do not pass the check, the published JOIN covers 
1,430 surveys in 162 countries. JOIN currently provides 105 standardized labor market indicators 
derived from household surveys, representing the most common indicators used for World Bank’s 
jobs diagnostics. 
Additionally, in 2020 the team launched a new Microsoft Excel-based JOIN benchmarking tool 
to give users more options to customize analysis. The tool, based on disaggregated JOIN data, 
allows users to choose the country they want to analyze, the timeline, and survey types. Several 
predefined “pivot” tables facilitate tabulations of different subgroups, such as gender, urban/rural, 
age groups, employment status, employment types, sectors, occupations, and education level. The 
tool enables not only the display of indicators for subgroups but also the interaction between these 
subgroup-level indicators. To further customize analysis, users can easily modify the pivot tables and 
their design. They can, for example, add or change subgroups, ranging from urban versus rural to 
education level by gender. The JOIN benchmarking tool points users to the Jobs Diagnostic-guided 
inquiry if they want to conduct a standardized jobs diagnostic. Additionally, users can modify standard 
outputs from the guided enquiry and compare their chosen country against up to 10 other countries. 
SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE JOBS LENDING AT SCALE (SEJLS)
The MDTF launched the SEJLS program in July 2019, following consultations with the Jobs 
MDTF donor partners and the JSC. SEJLS better defines and measures outcomes and benefits 
from jobs-relevant policies and programs; as such, it focuses on leveraging large-scale WBG lending 
operations, and improving design consistency of their jobs-relevant components and estimation of 
jobs outcomes. SEJLS implemented between July, 2019 and June, 2021 will use the available Jobs 
MDTF funding balance of just over US$ 5 million. 
5	 World Development Report 2012 and the SDGs both reference the importance of more, good quality jobs.

## Page 41
The first round of SEJLS incorporates fifteen “champion projects” representing strategic 
and jobs-relevant WBG business lines. The JSC selected the projects based on advice from the 
Jobs Technical Working Group (TWG)—composed of senior GP and IFC staff members. The SEJLS 
champion project relied on two criteria: they map to strategic operational areas where the WBG will 
increase its future portfolio focus, and they have high potential to address jobs challenges.
To build comprehensive operational knowledge, SEJLS supports operations using different 
WBG lending instruments. The WBG employs a range of different lending instruments, depending 
on appropriateness for development objectives. Most SEJLS champion projects employ Investment 
Project Financing (IPF). Two operations supported employ Program for Results (P4R) financing—
which use a country’s own institutions and processes and link WB fun disbursement to achievement 
of specific program results. Finally, one SELJLS-supported project is a Development Policy Lending 
(DPL) instrument, which supports policy and institutional actions.
The SEJLS portfolio reflects the cross-cutting nature of jobs and their multi-sectoral aspects. 
The champion projects range across six WBG GPs and two Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas (CCSAs)—
namely Gender and Fragility and Conflict and Violence (FCV).
FIGURE 3.1
Geographical Distribution of Projects Supported by SEJLS
The selected projects cover five WBG lending regions. Most (nine) explore jobs-related project 
components of lending operations in African, European, and Central Asian countries. In terms of 
lending quotas in associated projects, projects in African and South Asian countries make up the 
largest share (63 percent). Annex C presents progress on SEJLS at the grant level covering the 15 
champion projects. Some common trends across projects over the calendar year 2020 include:

The SEJLS pilot aims to validate an approach to improve the WBF jobs line of work, focusing 
on leveraging the relevant WBG portfolio. In particular, SEJLS aims to shift the operational 
approach to jobs towards a more comprehensive definition of jobs outcomes and a broader analytical 
framework to estimate its effects. 
The most direct SEJLS benefit is to influence jobs-relevant initiatives across the WBG and 
hold them to higher standards. This can be measured by how many projects adhere to the higher 
technical standards elaborated by the Jobs Group and by the results of the increased analytical 
scrutiny.
In line with SEJLS objectives, supported activities include jobs-relevant components within 
existing or planned operational engagements. Across sectors and types of interventions, SEJLS 
supports activities aiming to maximize jobs outcome benefits of the associated WBG investments.

These include optimizing project component/instrument design and improved economic analysis 
and monitoring and evaluation. For mature projects, this includes adapting project design to 
support additional financing, and incorporation of pilots to explore validity of new jobs-relevant 
project components.
The COVID-19 crisis occurred soon after the team had finalized SEJLS project proposals. This 
hindered WBG operational teams from implementing several agreed activities. Restrictions on travel 
and movement and prioritization of emergency response interventions caused major obstacles in 
implementing SEJLS support activities.
As a consequence, while most of these jobs activities are experiencing delays, their relevance 
has increased. Beyond common delays, the large majority of the activities planned to support SEJLS 
champion projects have not been revised after COVID-19. In fact, the evolving crisis has increased 
pressure across sectors to respond to the dramatic pandemic labor market crisis. Being designed to 
support operations to maximize jobs outcomes, SEJLS activities are a priority for COVID‑19 recovery.
SOLUTIONS FOR YOUTH EMPLOYMENT (S4YE)
This year the team further scaled-up S4YE activities across all pillars of the work program, 
despite COVID-19 challenges. The following represents a summarized update on all aspects of 
the S4YE work program.
As planned, the S4YE’s Board met twice last year in May 2020 and November 2020. The 
May 2020 meeting also facilitated a change of the Board Chair from the Rockefeller Foundation to 
Microsoft on completion of the two-year tenure. The SPJ Global Director, who represents the World 
Bank on the S4YE Board/Steering Committee, nominated Microsoft as incoming Board chair. In 
addition, the team also facilitated bilateral consultations between the new Chair Naria Santa Lucia 
of Microsoft and each member of the S4YE Board to seek feedback on strategic priorities.
S4YE created and launched a Knowledge Repository for Youth Employment Practitioners 
last year, which hosts tools developed by the World Bank and by S4YE partners. This online, 
live, searchable database of tools, guidance notes, and reports represents a global public good for 
any youth employment practitioner. This year the team further updated the Repository and added 
70 new practitioner tools/toolkits. The Repository now has over 300 tools/resources for youth 
employment practitioners. The team also created four new categories under the Repository: Youth 
with Disabilities, Digital Economy, Green Economy, and Agriculture.
The team led creation of two thematic reports and two MDTF Solution Notes:
•	 Jobs in the Orange Economy, which highlights opportunities in creative sectors for youth 
employment. This Note, was authored in partnership with the Digital Development GP, the 
S4YE Impact Portfolio partners, the Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator, and the Pakistan 
Poverty Alleviation Fund
•	 Digital Jobs for Youth Disabilities was developed in partnership with internal and external 
partners through a small Working Group, including the World Bank’s Social Inclusion GP (Global 
Disability Advisor team) and the Social Protection GP. The Group also included S4YE partners 
the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), the United States Agency for

Divide (DDD), Enablecode, Youth Business International (YBI), Leonard Cheshire, Humanity & 
Inclusion (HI), Partnership on Employment & Accessible Technology (PEAT), Cisco, Fingertalk 
Enterprise, and V-Shesh.
The team published three Knowledge Briefs: 
•	 Knowledge Brief 10—How are Youth Employment programs adapting to COVID-19? 
(in  partnership with Impact Portfolio partners IYF, Harambee, RBK, and Youth Business 
International etc.) This Note curated new, just-in-time changes to youth programs and their 
delivery models in response to COVID‑19. 
•	 Knowledge Brief 11—How Technology Can Help Incorporate Youth Voice In Employment 
Programs? (in partnership with Educate! and Africa’s Voices Foundation). This Note outlined 
practical ways that youth employment programs can use technology to incorporate youth voice 
in program design.
•	 Knowledge Brief 12—How private sector companies are supporting youth employment during 
COVID? (in partnership with S4YE private sector partners Coursera, Facebook, Microsoft, Visa, 
Avasant Foundation, Accenture, and others). This Note curated all ongoing private company 
efforts—especially those in the S4YE partner network—to support youth employment 
during COVID‑19.
S4YE launched a new “How to” series to provide a quick step-by-step guide in 1–2 pages 
for practitioners and policymakers designing new youth employment programs. The team 
published two “How to” Notes in 2020 in partnership with the World bank’s Mexico Youth Labor 
Market Inclusion (MYLMI) project:
•	 “How to” Note Issue 1—How To Include Youth Voice In Youth Employment Programs?
•	 “How to” Note Issue 2—How To Design An SMS Outreach Strategy In Youth Employment 
Programs? 
The team partnered with World Bank’s Youth-2-Youth (Y2Y) team to organize the following 
knowledge sharing sessions: 
•	 Presentation for S4YE “Integrating Youth Voice In Program Design” Webinar (November 2020).
•	 Presentation for S4YE-Y2Y joint webinar on “Making remote work accessible for Ukraine’s 
vulnerable youth in the COVID era via online training” (October 2020).
•	 Presentation for S4YE-Y2Y joint webinar on “The Power of Youth Communities in Scaling Up 
Skills Innovation” (October 2020).
•	 Presentation for the S4YE-Y2Y joint webinar on “How do we engage young people in the 
agriculture sector to build more sustainable and resilient global food systems post-COVID-19?” 
(September 2020).
The S4YE team continued to build and deepen partnerships. S4YE launched a very successful 
series of monthly webinars highlighting the work of a private sector partner each month, in an effort 
to strengthen partnership with the private sector and bring insights and lessons to WBG teams. 
Over 150–220 participants joined each webinar with several follow up emails helped establish

new dialogue and partnerships between private sector and WBG teams. Annex G details the eight 
monthly webinars.
Impact Portfolio Community of Practice: The S4YE team continued to strengthen its work 
with its community of practice (CoP). The team conducted an end of FY survey (June 2020) 
with its Impact Portfolio partners to seek feedback on strategic priorities and collaborate on work 
planning. The team also scheduled a series of meetings immediately after the COVID‑19 outbreak 
to collect insights on how IP projects were changing content and work delivery with youth to adapt 
to COVID‑19. The consultations resulted in a practical Note on specific ways to adapt to COVID‑19. 
S4YE teamed with other organizations to support their workshops and events and share 
lessons, including:
•	 Nestle Alliance Annual Summit (December 2020).
•	 International Outsourcing Professional Annual Forum (November 2020).
•	 Local Economic Development Series: “How can we Support the Employment of Vulnerable 
Youth During and After COVID-19 Webinar?” (October 2020).
•	 3rd Annual IZA / World Bank / NJD / UNU-WIDER Jobs and Development Conference: Better 
Jobs for Development (September 2020).
The S4YE team strengthened its support role to internal WBG teams, supporting different 
GPs and the IFC and providing technical advice and suggestions to various TTLs. For details

ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS FROM ONGOING JOBS MDTF GRANTS
This section provides a progress update on activities and results from ongoing grants over 
calendar year 2020. 
The Jobs Group continued its engagement in Mozambique through the Let’s Work Partnership 
Country Pilot (Grant Amount US$ 4.6 million). A Jobs Strategy Note summarized recent 
Bank analytical work on Mozambique and integrated the most important policy and program 
recommendations for accelerating jobs transformation stemming from the Let’s Work program’s 
activities in Mozambique. The team also advanced the following four activities that it will complete 
by the grant closure date (May 2021): 
(i)	
More and Better Jobs from Crops and Trees in Mozambique. The focus of this value chain 
study is to identify entry points and policy implications for creation of more and better jobs 
through three agricultural value chains: cassava, cashew, and plantation forestry. It aims to help 
inform ongoing debates in Mozambique on how agriculture and natural resource management 
can contribute to rural jobs transformation. 
(ii)	 Mozambique Agriculture Aggregator Pilot Study (MAAP). The final report presents the 
findings of a three-year evaluation of aggregator schemes in Mozambique, and seeks to 
understand the factors behind the success of some anchor firms’ and in terms of farmer 
profitability. The key motivating idea of the study is that poor contract growers may benefit 
from aggregator firms’ expansions, but initial firm returns may be low. This calls for an 
H I G H L I G H T S  O F  A C T I V I T I E S  A N D  R E S U L T S
37


## Page 46
integrated approach to understand aggregator systems growers and at commercial firms. 
Farmer income gains represent a “jobs-linked externality,” which might justify using public 
resources to support firm expansions. 
(iii)	 Biscate: Biscate is a private labor market matching platform connecting informal service 
workers with clients through a hybrid technology (internet-based for clients and Unstructured 
Supplementary Service Data (USSD)-based for workers without smartphones). Such platforms 
can help overcome labor market “information asymmetries” and help workers access better jobs. 
A Let’s Work Partnership evaluation of the platform aimed to quantify service provider earnings 
benefits as well as the increase in demand for such services. The final report will integrate 
lessons learned from deployment of the platform and considerations on its effectiveness.
(iv)	 Enterprise Survey of firms’ jobs growth potential and COVID-19 effects on firms and jobs: 
in collaboration with the World Bank Enterprise Survey team, this study—which will inform 
component 2 of the World Bank Demographic Dividend Project in Mozambique—was originally 
designed to support employment creation through a Business Plan Competition (BPC) and 
inform the design of activities of the Mozambique Let’s Work partners in the area of youth 
employment and private sector development. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
team has also carried out a pulse survey on COVID-19 effects on the private sector, and on 
what short-term assistance measures firms prefer. This has been done in collaboration with 
the World Bank Enterprise Survey team.
(v)	 Improving Jobs of Smallholder Women Farmers grant in Mozambique (Grant Amount 
US$ 0.3 million). This grant funds the design and implementation of two training interventions 
for female farmers as part of a World Bank feeder road rehabilitation operation in Tete province, 
Mozambique. Benefits from these interventions are being evaluated using a rigorous 
Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) approach including 2,240 women in 112 villages located 
along three feeder roads in Angonia, Macanga, and Tsangano districts. The WB-funded project 
selected two of the roads for rehabilitation. The team analyzed data to measure benefits of 
the two training interventions, showing that Personal Initiative (“soft skills”) training fostered 
entrepreneurship outside the farm, doubling the share of women running profitable off-farm 
businesses and generating an important additional source of household income. The team also 
found that Personal Initiative training enhances the effectiveness of agricultural extension (“hard 
skills”), leading to large increases in area cultivated and adoption of fertilizers, pesticides, good 
farming practices (such crop rotation and mulching), and cash crops (including soy), generating 
greater overall value of harvest sold. Further, the team found that that household expenditure 
increased in the target group, with results persisting after the interventions left the field. The 
team is currently drafting a policy brief and an academic paper to disseminate results.
In Liberia, the Youth Opportunities Impact Evaluation (IE) Grant (Grant Amount US$ 0.35 million) 
addresses key questions on how to cost-effectively promote self-employment and entrepreneurship 
in fragile and conflict-affected states (FCS). The IE centers around the Government of Liberia’s 
Small Business Support (SBS) (formerly known as Household Enterprise Support) component of the 
Youth Opportunities Program (YOP). The study assesses return on investment to integrating skills 
training with start-up grants versus provision of start-up grants alone to youth business groups. the 
IE design randomly assigned eligible youth to different interventions under SBS. The IE tests the

## Page 47
hypothesis that youth in Liberia are capital-constrained, which limits their ability to effectively pursue 
self-employment and entrepreneurship. Preliminary results indicate that self-employment increased 
for treatment group beneficiaries, while their financial inclusion and ownership of business assets 
also increased compared to the control group. 
In Nepal, the Jobs Platform (Grant Amount US$ 0.5 million) supports better jobs outcomes in 
Nepal’s formal and informal sector, especially for low-income workers and excluded groups. There 
are two main outcomes of this multi-pronged effort:
(i)	
Publication of a comprehensive diagnostic of Nepal’s jobs challenges with implications for 
future job creation and quality, and a set of integrated strategic policy interventions to address 
labor demand and supply challenges. In 2020, the team published the SME study “Market 
Study to Understand Job Growth Potential in SMEs in Nepal”, central to the labor demand 
analysis in the Jobs Diagnostic. The SME study findings, disseminated through a validation 
workshop in July 2019 with Government officials, partners, commercial banks, investors, 
business support organizations and members of civil society, reflected the range of actors in 
the SME ecosystem. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Jobs Diagnostic report dissemination 
took place through virtual sessions with the Government and development partners, as well 
as internally within the World Bank through a joint webinar organized with the Gender Group. 
(ii)	  Improved alignment of the Nepal lending portfolio with jobs objectives. This was achieved 
through assessment of the current WB portfolio mapping against the three-pillar Jobs 
Conceptual Framework (JCF) for monitoring jobs impacts (more, better, and more inclusive 
jobs). This assessment identified support gaps at the project and portfolio levels when 
considered against national priorities. The team also developed a new portfolio monitoring 
system—the Jobs Impact Measurement tool (JIM): a user-friendly matrix for the CMU to track 
WB project current and future projects designed to explicitly mitigate key jobs challenges. The 
JIM tool incorporates jobs-specific measurement indicators to help TTLs track impacts and lay 
the groundwork for future jobs-focused project components. A CMU can easily update the 
tool, disseminated to and validated by TTLs, to reflect country team discussions and evolving 
jobs-related objectives.
In Mexico, the Youth Labor Market Inclusion grant (Grant Amount US$ 2.0 million) is 
designing, piloting, and evaluating innovative approaches to improve employment outcomes 
for low-income youth graduating from upper secondary education and transitioning into the 
labor market. The project engages targeted youth before entering the labor market and offers them 
a package of interventions to guide study and work decisions, strengthen job search skills, and 
connect graduates with quality employment opportunities in strategic, productive sectors. Targeted 
low-income youth include former beneficiaries of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs. In 2020, 
trained staff delivered a labor market literacy workshop at upper secondary schools as part of the 
project. At the end of the workshop, a randomly selected sample of 970 youths from the total 1,924 
received an offer to obtain a FEI if able to prove permanence in formal employment after graduation. 
Early evaluation show that FEI increases the short-term probability of being formally employed and 
a increases job stability in the formal labor market. The team also found that the increase in job 
experience associated with the FEI increases workers’ salaries. Emerging findings suggest that 
formal jobs may have also have helped protect youth from COVID-19 crisis effects.

UNDERSTANDING AND RESPONDING TO COVID-19
COVID-19 has caused not only a global health crisis but also an economic and jobs crisis. Due 
to illness and health concerns, travel bans, quarantine measures, and other mobility constraints, 
many workers cannot work. Those that do work experience productivity—and often incomes—
decreases. Global and local supply chain disruption have decreased labor demand, and businesses 
closed or remain open only limited hours across many countries. Even when operating, lower 
consumer demand affects earnings.
Labor market prospects worsened rapidly due to COVID-19 effects on labor supply and 
demand. Many people have become vulnerable to reduced income, furloughs, or layoffs from the 
crisis, and millions of jobs could be lost permanently. ILO projections suggest that labor market 
recovery during the second half of 2020 will be incomplete, with unemployment expected to rise by 
between 140 million and 340 million—per the most pessimistic scenario, which assumes a second 
wave of the pandemic. Even in the most optimistic scenario, which assumes a fast recovery, global 
working hours are unlikely to return to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2020.
While there was already a significant demand in WBG countries for support on jobs programs, 
COVID‑19 has cast a sharp light on the importance of implementing effective jobs strategies. 
Improving our understanding of jobs outcomes and of what programs deliver benefits on the ground 
remains a priority. This huge COVID-19 crisis might represent an opportunity to address some 
obstacles to better jobs outcomes that existed pre-COVID‑19. The extent of employment effects 
from the pandemic depends on policy responses, and countries risk severe and long-lasting effects 
if policies are not timely or effective. 
At the same time, pandemic disruptions and the speed with which the crisis has unfolded 
have created new measurement challenges. Methods and sources normally used to track labor 
market outcomes may have significant shortcomings. Furthermore, social distancing and other 
transmission prevention measures have affected several data-related activities around the world, 
potentially limiting data availability, quality, and reliability.
The massive COVID‑19 labor market disruptions affect all categories of workers, but 
some groups have been particularly negatively affected. Women workers have suffered 
disproportionally, particularly due to the service sector downturn. Women also account for a large 
proportion of workers in front-line occupations, especially in the health and social care sectors where 
they represent 70 percent of workforce. Finally, closures of early childhood education centers, 
care services, and schools, along with the unavailability of older relatives to provide support, have 
exacerbated lack of childcare. Care services are not only key for job creation, they also sustain 
workforce participation by providing critical support to workers. Young people are also critically 
affected by the COVID-19 crisis. A total of 178 million young workers around the world—more than 
four in ten employed young people globally—worked in hard-hit sectors when the crisis began. 
Both technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and on-the-job training have suffered 
massive disruptions.
Jobs MDTF initiatives represent an important part of the WBG’s COVID-19 response strategy,

client labor market disruptions. Across the SEJLS portfolio, activities that involve data collection are 
considering adding specific modules on COVID-19 to deepen the understanding of the impact of the 
pandemic on beneficiaries targeted by the projects. SEJLS projects are very important strategically 
in terms of their potential to generate positive jobs outcomes. For example:
•	 In Cambodia, SEJLS supports the severely disrupted tourism sector by promoting nature-based 
tourism activities to attract visitors while reducing pressure on natural resources. 
•	 In Bangladesh, SEJLS supports an operation promoting private investment and job creation in 
economic zones and digital entrepreneurship in hi-tech parks. Support focuses on estimating 
expected jobs and earnings benefit (direct, indirect, and induced job creation) over a five and 
a ten-year period from investment, contributing to maximize employment creation during 
COVID‑19 recovery.
•	 In Ghana, SEJLS funds contribute to strengthen the design and implementation of skills 
development programs, aiming to maximize the project’s effects on job creation. 
The new JobsWatch initiative addresses key questions on the effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic on developing countries’ labor markets.6 High-frequency phone survey (HFPS) 
collected data to estimate crisis’ labor markets disruptions in 39 countries. Data obtained between 
April and July 2020 showed that workers in these countries experienced severe labor market 
disruptions following the outbreak. 
COVID-19 “JOBSWATCH” 
The JobsWatch initiative helps inform labor market policy responses during the evolving 
crisis to prepare for recovery. The development objective of this activity is to synthesize and 
generate new evidence on COVID-19 labor market effects on workers, households, and firms, and 
to track economic policy responses. The Jobs group in the Social Protection and Jobs GP and the 
Data for Goals group in the Poverty and Equity GP co-led the JobsWatch initiative to address four 
key questions for as much of the developing world as possible: 
•	 What are the labor market disruptions of the crisis on workers, households, and firms, and how 
do these vary across countries and over time?
•	 Which types of workers and jobs have been most negatively affected by the crisis? What does 
this imply for distributional labor market effects?
•	 What were the policy responses to the crisis and how do they correlate with the magnitude of 
the labor market disruptions at different phases of the crisis?
•	 How does the COVID-19 crisis affect the medium-term policy agenda to promote economic 
transformation and better jobs for more people?
JobsWatch collaborated with related activities of two key Bank teams. The first was the team 
led by the Poverty and Equity GP in collaboration with DEC and the Finance, Competitiveness and 
Innovation (FCI) GP on collecting and harmonizing HFPS monitoring data from households and/or 
firms in over 100 countries. While the Poverty & Equity GP provides dashboards and reports with

general summary statistics from the phone surveys, the “JobsWatch” initiative will complement 
them with more in-depth analysis on labor market outcomes. The second key Bank team in the 
Social Protection and Jobs GP is collects information on social protection policy responses to the 
crisis from a variety of country focal points and other international organizations. 
JobsWatch will complement and extend the efforts of partner international organizations to 
monitor labor market responses to the crisis. The ILO also monitors labor market conditions and 
releases regular updates of its Global Employment Trends. Similarly, the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and IMF also analyze labor market trends, building upon 
ILO information. JobsWatch will complement these efforts through monitoring employment trends 
in five important ways:
(i)	
Based on the Bank High-Frequency Monitoring phone survey, conducted in coordination with 
national statistics offices, which will contribute new household survey data to the effort.
(ii)	 Focus on developing countries, unlike the OECD.
(iii)	 	Compares outcomes across selected countries, in addition to regional monitoring. This is 
important because lessons from the 2008 financial crisis indicate that economic shock effects 
vary widely across different countries in the same region. Understanding this can provide 
insights into transmission mechanisms, countries that suffered most, and policies that mitigate 
crisis effects.
(iv)	 Describes detailed data sources and methodologies used to measure crisis effects.
(v)	 Explores how the crisis affects vulnerable workers, such as the poor, young, and lower-skilled. 
To the extent possible, it will exploit longitudinal data to document effects on different types 
of workers across crisis stages. 
(vi)	 Investigates how the “new normal” will permanently shift the policy agenda to promote Jobs 
and economic transformation in developing countries.
Early JobsWatch findings suggest that 34 percent of respondents reported stopping work, 20 
percent of wage workers reported lack of payment for work performed, 9 percent reported job 
changes due to the pandemic, and 62 percent reported household income loss. Twenty-two 
percent of agricultural workers reported stopping work, as opposed to 40 percent for industry and 
38 percent for services. This suggests that disruptions to labor markets were substantial. In addition 
to stopping work, pay reductions due to decreased economic activity represented an important 
challenge. Many workers kept their jobs but were not receiving full payment for work performed, 
possibly due to furlough or employers delaying or reducing pay.
HFPS estimates of work stoppage and income loss are generally consistent with reductions 
in gross domestic products (GDP) projections in Latin America and the Caribbean, but not in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, indicating that phone survey data contributes valuable new information 
about crisis effects. Ensuring future availability of such critical data requires investments in 
statistical and physical infrastructure as well as human capital to set up Emergency Observatories, 
which can rapidly deploy phone surveys to inform decision makers.

In response to the pandemic, S4YE stepped up its role of facilitating catalytic action and 
collective learning between World Bank teams, the private sector, and portfolio partners. 
In particular, the S4YE team has been facilitating just-in-time learning through organizing peer-
to-peer learning sessions and publishing short practical knowledge briefs on practical solutions. 
Early after the pandemic hit, the S4YE team connected with all its Impact Portfolio (IP) project 
partners to understand how these youth employment programs were dealing with COVID‑19 and 
how they would ensure continued youth support. Drawing on practical solutions curated from these 
discussions, S4YE published a Knowledge Brief “How are youth employment programs adapting 
to COVID” to highlight innovative ways youth employment projects adapted curriculum, services, 
and delivery models.

Overall S4YE team identified six main strategies that youth employment programs were 
using to maintain operational and programmatic continuity: (i) scaling virtual operations, (ii) 
crowdsourcing ideas from youth, (iii) accelerating remote learning, (iv) encouraging youth voice, 
(v) increasing support for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and(vi) leveraging new 
growth opportunities. 
One of the four pillars of S4YE’s ecosystem is a network of private sector companies 
committed to addressing youth employment challenges. Through S4YE’s Private Sector Advisory 
Council (PSAC), private sector partners learn, showcase, and support scaling innovative youth 
employment interventions. Since the pandemic, several S4YE partner companies have taken several 
rapid measures, launched new initiatives, or modified existing youth support programs. The S4YE 
curated and shared these efforts in a new Knowledge Brief, “How S4YE’s private sector partners 
supported youth employment in COVID.” Efforts included: (i) Support for Digital Skill Building, Online 
Learning/Training and Employment for Youth, (ii) Support to Build Resilience among MSMEs, (iii) 
Support for Youth Focused NGOs, (iv) Immediate Emergency Support to Public Authorities, and (v) 
Internal Measures to Ensure Business Continuity within the Organizations.
The S4YE team also hosted monthly online, peer-to-peer learning sessions with dedicated 
sessions on digital skills. These included Implementing an online learning platform (Facebook 
& Coursera); Scaling workforce development during COVID (IFC & Coursera); Teaching practical 
skills online (Commonwealth of Learning); and support for young entrepreneurs through, for 
example, Supporting Women-Owned Small Businesses (Facebook & Association for Enterprise 
Opportunity); Rapid Response to support youth entrepreneurs (Youth Business International, Google, 
and Accenture).
Finally, S4YE launched the Youth Advisory Group (YAG) COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Blog series. 
The series highlighted COVID-19 pandemic effects on young people and discussed YAG member 
local approaches to the crisis. The blogs focused on youth-developed solutions to address the food 
crisis, workforce training, health care, and harnessing social media.
NEXT STEPS
Initiate Jobs MDTF’s Phase II implementation for 2021 to 2025. Responding to IDA donors 
and government goals, during its second phase, the MDTF will focus on supporting large-scale 
operationalization of the jobs agenda, while continuing to support an innovative work program to 
address knowledge gaps. 
Continue SEJLS program implementation and invest in understanding jobs outcomes 
through data and analytics. The MDTF will continue to strengthen the design consistency of 
jobs-relevant project components and estimation of jobs outcomes. Targeted jobs indicators will 
vary across project types, but could include direct, indirect, and induced effects on the quantity 
and quality of jobs, and indicators on the characteristics of beneficiaries, such as males/females 
disaggregated by age, education, location, ethnicity/race, disability, and other relevant characteristics. 
Similarly, the MDTF will continue to support the measurement agenda. Improving understanding 
of jobs outcomes from WBG interventions is a high priority for the WBG, its shareholders, and 
H I G H L I G H T S  O F  A C T I V I T I E S  A N D  R E S U L T S

## Page 54
other stakeholders. Equally important is to disaggregate jobs reporting by gender and by other key 
dimensions, such as age, income, location, ethnicity, and disability.
Promote exchange of best practices and lessons from MDTF outputs and tools to help 
build development partners’ capacity. Beyond the WBG, it is crucial to reinforce the broader 
discussion on improving jobs outcomes with development partners as well as government and 
private sector actors. An important Jobs Group and Jobs MDTF role is to support dialogue between 
government agencies charged with addressing the jobs agenda—such as job creation commissions, 
competitiveness councils, and national training agencies—and leverage private sector involvement 
to identify opportunities for, and constraints to, accelerated job creation. During Phase I of the 
MDTF, the Let’s Work program supported advances on the jobs agenda in pilot countries such as 
Bangladesh, Mozambique, Tunisia, and Paraguay. During Phase II, the MDTF will ramp up its work 
with governments, private sector actors, and development partners to promote private sector-led 
jobs growth.
Maximize linkages to the JET theme, focusing on the poorest countries. Consensus is growing 
that accelerating economic transformation is the only way to create more and better jobs in a 
sustainable way and at scale. Successful transformation means responding to evolving technology 
and skills demand while taking account of economies’ resource endowments and comparative 
advantages. To increase production, firms need to invest in capital and technology. To raise labor 
productivity, workers must move towards jobs and sectors with higher value-added.7 This requires 
macroeconomic stability with low, stable inflation to help firms identify and respond to price signals. 
Open trade regimes; a competitive business environment; a flexible labor market; good quality, 
market-relevant education and training programs; better infrastructure; and an investment‑friendly 
business climate all help to facilitate job-creating private investment and allow workers and 
entrepreneurs to increase earnings. This broad agenda is at the core of the JET Special Theme 
incorporated under IDA 18, and further reinforced in IDA19. The Jobs MDTF will play a key role in 
supporting JET operationalization during Phase II by improving conceptual framing of a growing 
pipeline of WBG projects addressing jobs. It will also support improved measurement by contributing 
to efforts to better estimate indirect jobs effects from WBG operations.
Develop a community of practice (COP) of jobs-focused government agencies. Several 
client country government units have expressed interest in participating in S4YE’s innovation and 
practitioner-oriented learning community. This new COP responds to that demand by promoting 
informal exchange of practices and practical lessons between countries. This learning platform will 
facilitate and promote knowledge exchange on youth employment and broader jobs challenges and 
solutions to improve state capacity to address challenges. 
Build an agile public-private initiative on digital jobs in response to COVID-19. In collaboration 
with the Digital Development GP and S4YE’s private sector partners, this work will include promoting 
online work and digital public works, building digital capacity of S4YE/NGO partners, and developing 
a jobs agenda around broadband connectivity.

 Reallocation of resources to most productive uses may result in efficiency gains due to better use of resources or 
firms’ choices in their mix of factors of production. The latter may also affect capital and labor intensity of activities.

Advance the “Jobs-After-COVID” workstream. Building on lessons learned through the JobsWatch 
initiative and other fund activities mobilized in response to COVID-19, the Jobs Umbrella MDTF 
will continue focusing on medium-term prospects for accelerating jobs transitions in developing 
countries in the aftermath of the pandemic. This workstream will build on the recently launched 
Jobs-After-COVID call for proposals, which aims to identify and accelerate pioneering diagnosis 
of, and solutions to, post-pandemic jobs challenges. Work in this area also includes leveraging 
learning from the current pandemic, such as analyzing effects from policy responses, with a view 
to improving resilience against future crises.

are provided loans and grants through International Development Association (IDA) and middle and high-income countries are given 
loans through International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Few countries are eligible to receive assistance from 
both the IDA and IBRD and are classified as Blend countries. World Bank also lends to countries with whom it doesn’t have an 
agreement through special financing products. In the chart above special financing refers to grant given to a West Bank and Gaza

ANNEX B: 
BENEFICIARIES REACHED BY WBG JOBS PROGRAMS
BOX B.1 
BENEFICIARIES REACHED BY WBG JOBS PROGRAMS
The Jobs Group estimates the beneficiaries of jobs interventions at three levels*: 
(i)	
Direct beneficiaries of MDTF grants: Some MDTF-funded activities (such as pilots and IEs, 
among others) reach beneficiaries directly. This is reported by grant recipients in the results 
framework and stands at 41,182 beneficiaries, according to the latest estimates. 
(ii)	 Leveraged Portfolio Level: 43 Jobs MDTF Phase I grants are associated with 58 World Bank 
lending operations, valued at $7.74 billion. Of these, 22 projects track the number of direct 
project beneficiaries, which amounted to 6.9 million cumulatively per the latest estimate. 
Additionally, SEJLS grants are associated with 15 lending operations expected to reach 
2.4 million cumulative beneficiaries. 
(iii)	 Corporate Level: The corporate results indicator “beneficiaries of jobs-focused interventions” 
estimates the number of beneficiaries reached by jobs-relevant interventions in WBG‑supported 
operations, on the basis of data reported by the projects. In FY 2020, 238 jobs lending projects 
supported 14.5 million jobs, including 9.9 million in IDA countries, 3.1 million in IBRD countries, 
and 6.1 million female beneficiaries.
Note: *Includes people benefiting from innovative, scalable pilot programs (enhanced skills, reduced job search time, entry into 
self-employment, increase in income and/or earnings, improved quality of employment, greater productivity); and beneficiaries 
reached by jobs-focused WBG interventions supported by the MDTF, including both individuals and government agencies as well as 
private sector.

ANNEX C: 
PROJECT-LEVEL UPDATES ON SEJLS ACTIVITIES
AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
BANGLADESH
LIVESTOCK AND DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
P161246
Development objective
To improve productivity, market access, and resilience of small‐holder farmers and agro‐entrepreneurs 
operating in selected livestock value chains in target areas.
Grant Activity 1
Activity I—A framework for job measurement in livestock operations: The team will prepare 
a technical note on the jobs measurement framework that will outline an underlying methodology 
to measure direct, indirect, and induced jobs outcomes of investment operations in the livestock 
sector. The note will outline an approach to measure jobs outcome in three different dimensions: 
i) Job Creation—outcomes related to the creation of more jobs for project beneficiaries along 
the value-chains; ii) Job Quality—outcomes focus on the ability of beneficiaries to achieve 
enhanced productivity levels and higher earnings; and iii) Job Access—outcomes related to 
connecting people (especially women and youth) to jobs from inactivity, unemployment, and 
underemployment. It will also address the underlying structure of data and information required to 
measure FTE jobs in these three dimensions. Besides supporting the M&E system of the LDDP, 
the note will inform the M&E systems of future livestock operations to engage a more systematic 
assessment of job outcomes.
The expected output of this activity is a technical note outlining the job measurement framework 
for the livestock operations highlighting a results chain of livestock operations to job outcome. 
Timeline 
The original completion date was August 30. As explained in the last progress update, both the 
Bank team and the client team have been heavily engaged with COVID-19 related emergency 
responses and the CERC component (US$ 96 million) in LDDP has been activated to address the 
impacts COVID‑19 in the sector.

Progress (as of December 2020)
This activity has progressed well in recent weeks and the drafting of the technical note is underway now.
The following tasks have been completed so far for this activity:
(i)	
A review of relevant literature has been conducted to reflect insights from the available 
knowledge to the technical note,
(ii)	 A results chain has been developed to demonstrate links between the project inputs to the 
expected job outcomes, 
(iii)	 A set of relevant indicators has been identified to capture the job outcomes from livestock 
operations, and 
(iv)	 A format for data collection to capture various types of job outcomes has been developed. 
Grant Activity 2
Activity II—Establishing a baseline for job indicators and an ex-ante estimation of job 
outcomes: This activity will estimate the baseline and ex-ante jobs outcome of the livestock and 
dairy development project in three dimensions described above. The activity will allow capturing 
jobs effect of the project along the value-chains with accuracy and showcasing the number of jobs 
created through the largest investment of the bank in the livestock sector. Although most of the job 
outcome of the project will be direct, an effort will be made to capture other indirect/induced jobs 
impacts along the whole livestock value chains, including backward linkages to input providers and 
forward linkages to processors, wholesalers, and food retailers. Key job outcomes and indicators, 
identified in Activity I, may include the number of FTE jobs created (job creation), number of FTE jobs 
with increased labor productivity or increased formality or reduced seasonality (quality job); and labor 
force participation rate among project beneficiaries, especially among women and youth (job access).
The expected output of this activity is a report on the estimation of baseline and ex-ante job 
outcomes of the LDDP. 
Timeline 
Expected to be completed by May 2021. 
Progress (as of December 2020)
This activity is a subsequent task and will utilize the framework developed under the first activity. 
Thus, this task will start following the completion of the Activity I. However, preparatory tasks 
(such as preparation of the ToR, identification of a potential consulting firm, and the development 
of survey instruments, etc.) are well underway. The recruitment process of the survey firm will start 
following the completion of the technical note under Activity I. Overall, this activity is on track for 
the completion within the planned timeline. 
The engagement of the client in the implementation of this activity has been discussed and ensured. 
A ToR has been drafted and will be finalized once the technical note from the Activity I is ready.

Lessons learned and client engagement
What problems did the task team encounter during implementations and what were 
some lessons learned? What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS 
scale up to more operations?
•	 The COVID-19 pandemic has moved the priorities of the client and the implementation of many 
regular project activities has been stalled due to the pandemic.
•	 Also, early exchanges of knowledge and ideas with the client about the importance of capturing 
job outcome of the project helped to bring the client on board for this task in addition to their 
original M&E activities and the results framework (RF) of the project.
•	 Engagement at the preparation stage of a project can yield better results through the inclusion 
of job measurement of project activities into the project M&E function and RF.
What did the task team do to build capacity in client countries (including NGOs, CSOs, 
and government agencies)?
The task team is in the process of providing technical assistance to the client to build capacity 
for capturing job outcomes of the project through their regular M&E process. 
ETHIOPIA
AGP2—ADDITIONAL FINANCING
P168074 (ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR P148591)
Development objective
To increase agricultural productivity and commercialization of small holder farmers targeted by 
the project.
Grant Activity 1
The objective of this activity is to understand the quantum and quality of jobs created under 
Agricultural Growth Program (AGP). Specifically: 
(1)	 Assess the number of direct jobs created through various project activities specified under 
each project component.
(2)	 Capture the multiplier effect of jobs through increased overall productivity and commercialization. 
(3)	 Provide technical assistance to the Federal Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to better track and 
monitor job created through AGP.
Timeline 
The implementation started in July 2020 and will be completed in October 2021.

Progress (as of December 2020)
Two consultants are hired for this assignment. The first consultant is carrying out the following 
activities: 
•	 Collect relevant information and develop sample frame for selected agricultural value chains 
through communicating AGP team and other institutions (USAID, ATA and EAIR).
•	 Develop survey tool (both qualitative and quantitative) to capture permanent as well as 
temporary jobs created under the project.
•	 There will be data to be collected from regions. Prior to going out for field work the consultant 
has to attend a mandatory security training. Currently, taking the online course. When completed, 
will go out for field data collection.
Likewise, the second consultant is carrying out the following activities: 
•	 Setup the latest version of Ethiopia’s Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). The earlier version 
available have issues such that some agricultural value chains are mixed up, some factors 
such as labor and non-agricultural capital were also slightly mixed up. In the latest version, the 
consultant has sorted out all these issues. 
•	 Synchronize this latest SAM with IFPRI’s Dynamic Recursive Computable General Equilibrium 
(CGE).
•	 Trying to calibrate productivity and labor related parameters into the CGE.
SOUTH SUDAN
SOUTH SUDAN RESILIENT AGRICULTURAL LIVELIHOODS PROJECT
P169120
Development objective
To improve food availability in the country through increased investment in seed production, farmer 
capacity building, and promoting mechanization in agriculture.
Grant Activity 1
Functional study on upstream and downstream job creation in ag / food value chains. The 
RALP will be investing to support actors along the value chain input—on farm—output. This activity 
will finance a firm contract to carry out the grant activities. First, it will catalogue the ways other 
donors are starting to support producer groups/cooperatives and enterprises, via a desk review 
supplemented by select interviews. Second, it will collect qualitative data on how to support job 
creation in input markets. RALP’s design already has a significant amount of support to jobs linked 
to upstream input markets given the urgent need to create supply chains for seeds, tools / machines, 
and information / training. There are plans to support agro-dealers and producer groups / cooperative, 
and development partners, such as FAO, are already testing methods of organizing farmers into 
groups and introducing intermediate technology (e.g. animal traction, walking tractors, solar 


## Page 75
irrigation). Third, it will track how post-harvest activities—processing, grading, storage, transport, 
marketing, etc.—can generate significant jobs. Development partners have distributed processing 
equipment to communities through a now-closed project, but the Jobs ASA shows agriculture 
processing is one of the enterprises / jobs about which youth have the most doubts. This activity 
will follow up on this finding by analyzing through desk review and qualitative data collection how 
processing has been supported and what changes could increase interest in these jobs.
Timeline 
Development of the RALP project was delayed by three events: complications in the overall country 
portfolio (e.g., alternative implementation arrangements) that slowed the processing pipeline; the 
COVID‑19 outbreak that, for a while, directed energy away from agriculture and toward health 
concerns; and the desert locust outbreak, which further directed energy to swarm management 
and recovery.
However, RALP is now on a rapid preparation schedule with a planned Board date of February 
2021. The design is being finalized with Ministry of Agriculture & Food Security and FAO as the 
implementer. The development of ways to stimulate input and output market jobs (including 
establishing baseline data and appropriate indicators and studies on job creation) have already been 
discussed, and this grant is how the RALP team will develop the job creation analytical framework 
for the project. The project does now have components on producer group formation and support, 
seed supply development, appropriate mechanization, producer training, and agro‑dealership 
development. An urgent need is to identify and describe the different forms of support being 
provided by different donors, and to pilot and study the different approaches under RALP to 
determine what works best and why?
Deliverables:
(i)	
Report outlining donor efforts to form and capacitate farmer/producer groups and to support 
agro-dealerships (Originally May 2020 / Revised January 2021)
(ii)	 Report outlining engagement principles with farmers, traders, artisans, etc.—particularly 
women and youth—that produces diverse investment plans geared to developing enterprises 
and jobs around agriculture. (Originally February 2021 / Revised April 2021)
(iii)	 A brief report outlining the obstacles (real and perceived) to develop processing jobs. (Originally 
October 2020 / Revised July 2021)
Progress (as of December 2020)
Due to the delays described above, this task is just getting started, but it will move quickly from this 
point. The grant team will join weekly design team meetings on the specifics of component activities, 
implementing arrangements, and monitoring systems—to stimulate job creation. Development 
partners on the ground and new CMU consultants can facilitate distance consultations with UN 
agencies, donors, farmer groups, and the government on the research questions asked. 
In the meantime, the team is leveraging information from high frequency surveys—in person before 
COVID‑19 and over the phone since the pandemic began. This an idea on the level of activity in 
agriculture linked livelihoods upstream and downstream from the farm.

Grant Activity 2 
Job indicators for the project results framework. To track job creation, the grant will recommend 
appropriate indicators that meet SMART standards and provide guidance on how to measure 
them. This activity may include travel, workshops, and staff / STC time to help ascertain what are 
meaningful and feasible measures of jobs outcomes. It may be accompanied by highly targeted 
qualitative or quantitative work to help fine-tune measures.
While the preparation of RALP was delayed, the grant team did continue gathering data on the 
types of employment happening in rural areas to help frame the activity once it started. RALP 
M&E system is now being designed, and it will be finalized through the team design meetings 
and intensive interactions with FAO and MAFS. The goal will be to go through the entire design of 
the project and determine the nature of the jobs that could be created—e.g., full-time / part-time; 
self‑employed / salaried, and at what part of the value chain—and how they can be measured. 
Timeline 
Discussions on the revised timeline have been ongoing as the COVID‑19 shut down continued. 
RALP design began in earnest in July once the project was cleared through concept. Discussions/
planning for the workshop commenced on 9/24/2020 with a team design meeting involving the 
World Bank, FAO, UNOPS, and MAFS.
Deliverables:
(i)	
A workshop to discuss indicators to measure job creation (Originally July 2020 / Revised 
January 2021)
(ii)	 A list of indicators with guidance on collection, measurement, and analysis (Originally July 
2020 / Revised January 2021)
Progress (as of December 2020)
The tasks are getting underway, but will begin by engaging MAFS, FAO, UNOPS and the Bank’s 
RALP team on the job creation goals for the project and the sector.
A brief seminar on the nature of job creation and measurement will be offered to ensure everyone 
is clear on the concepts to be promoted. 
The team will then develop a list of potential indicators and definitions for discussion among 
stakeholders on their feasibility in the South Sudan context. 
This will cover the first few months of the grant. 
Lessons learned and client engagement
What problems did the task team encounter during implementations and what were 
some lessons learned? What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS 
scale-up to more operations?
•	 The main challenges with client engagement in South Sudan before COVID‑19 was the ability 
to get time with the client, especially since the associated lending product had been delayed. 


## Page 77
•	 Accommodation limitations in Juba constrained the ability to have a mission, and it was 
important not to raise client expectations as issues with the portfolio pipeline were clarified. 
•	 When the COVID‑19 outbreak began, the Bank staff and clients were diverted with the COVID‑19 
and the locust emergency responses 
•	 Despite those limitations, team members have been able to leverage other work to determine 
that there is a strong interest in agricultural jobs, a unfamiliarity with agriculture processing jobs, 
a more robust farmer organization structure in the country that originally presumed will help in 
conceptualizing the nature of agriculture jobs that should be created. 
•	 More importantly, in the interim, the Government of South Sudan has started to recognize 
agriculture, livestock and fisheries as important sources of job creation outside of the oil sector. 
What did the task team do to build capacity in client countries (including NGOs, CSOs 
and government agencies)?
•	 Since the grant activities were delayed, we have not built capacity with the client yet, and 
earlier, the alternative implementation arrangements in place presented and especial challenge 
to building the capacity of the national government. 
•	 In recent months, the agenda has shifted, and is now more conducive to government capacity 
building, and the design of the RALP project reflects this change
•	 Therefore, this activity can work more closely with MAFS counterparts not only on understanding 
the different type of jobs that can be created and how to measure that, they can also gain 
capacity in systemic tracking of job creation to lobby for sufficient investment in agriculture and 
related enterprises to create jobs through investment programs. 
UZBEKISTAN
UZBEKISTAN LIVESTOCK SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
P153613
Development objective
To improve livestock productivity and access to market in selected regions of Uzbekistan.
Grant Activity 1: Measuring Jobs Created
The objective of this activity is to measure (direct and indirect) jobs that the project had helped 
create thus far and will help create in the future. This includes developing and employing tools to 
measure and monitor jobs created or to be created in the sector and analyze the nature of these 
jobs in terms of productivity and compensation. 
In terms of measuring jobs created directly, the firm identified a total of 290 (out of a total 504) 
beneficiaries in five (out of a total of 13) regions. The five regions constituted over 58% of direct 
project beneficiaries and more than 60% of the credit line disbursed to beneficiaries in the form of 
sub-loans. Besides, these regions collectively represented all categories of credit line beneficiaries, 
A N N E X  C

## Page 78
including dairy, beef (cattle), meat (sheep and goat), poultry (egg and meat), apiculture (honeybee) 
and aquaculture (fish) farmers; and (dairy and beef) processors/agri-businesses. The sampled 
290 beneficiaries are being interviewed using a questionnaire developed for that purpose, which 
includes, among other questions, the nature of the business and business capital, number of 
existing employees (both permanent and casual), additional number of jobs created as a result of 
the sub‑loan, salary and/or remuneration to employees, working condition of employees etc.
In terms of measuring jobs created indirectly, the sampled beneficiaries will be asked/interviewed 
about business partnerships that they had established as a result of the sub-loans. A very good 
example in this regard is poultry production. Poultry farms often managed to create indirect jobs 
through the sale of day-old chicks to small holder farmers who in turn started their own poultry 
(broiler or layer) farms. So, the question is how many such partnerships have been established and 
led to the creation of how many jobs. It is also expected that such business partnerships are highly 
likely to be established in dairy (where cows are sold by dairy farms to small holder farmers by way 
of culling), beef (where aged bulls might have been sold by beef farmers to small holder farmers) 
and meat (where sheep and goat farmers do the same). Dairy farmers might have also established 
business partnerships with milk collectors who would collect milk from their farms and deliver them 
to dairy processing plants. 
Timeline 
Initially, the plan was to finalize this activity by September 2020. However, with the COVID-19 related 
strict lock-down that became effective on 16 March 2020 and run until May 2020, it had become 
very difficult to start the work. This had forced the team to look for alternative ways of getting the 
job done. Thus, the team decided to adopt a different approach i.e. recruit a local firm and get the 
job done instead of the initially planned international consultant. This necessitated revision of the 
TOR, which the team managed to finalize within the shortest time possible. Following the revision 
of the TOR, the team identified and recruited a local firm who would undertake the consultancy. 
There had not been any change in methodology or output in shifting from international to local 
consultant since the methodology initially planned and now being implemented is a formal survey 
using questionnaire developed for the same purpose. The only change is the way the survey is now 
being undertaken, i.e. digital rather than physical or face to face. The firm jump started the work, 
including preparing the inception report, in the shortest time possible, and is now fully on board. 
The firm is in the process of data collection right now and is expected to deliver the final report by 
30 January 2021. The new completion date is different from the one indicated in the GFR (delayed 
by a month). This is caused by the COVID-19 outbreak that had led to a strict lock down, which in

and international). 
Progress (as of December 2020)
Following the approval of the SEJLS Proposal (linked to the UZ LSDP) in January/February 2020, as 
stipulated in the proposal, the team immediately started undertaking preparatory activities, including 
preparing TORs and recruiting consultants. As such, the team prepared two terms of references 
(ToRs)-one for an international consultant and another for a local consultant. The team then went 
ahead with identifying as well as getting the consent of the international consultant who would 
participate in the work, including scheduling the visit to Uzbekistan. As preparations advanced, the

Government of Uzbekistan (GoU) announced the first strict lock-down on 16 March 2020. The lock-
down restricted any movement/travel, including international travel and travel in the country, as well 
as limited the number of staff in government offices, including staff of project implementation units 
(only key staff were allowed to come to the office). The GoU started easing the lock-down only at the 
end of May (29 May 2020) but has announced the re-instatement of the strict lock‑down on 10 July 
2020 that extended until end of July. Following this, the firm started working on the consultancy and 
prepared the Inception Report on 6 August 2020. The firm is currently in the middle of data collection. 
Grant Activity 2: Lessons and Good Practice
The objective of this activity is documenting lessons learned and good practices. This includes 
distilling lessons by identifying and documenting good practices in measuring jobs created in 
animal source food value chains in terms of quantity and quality, which will in turn be useful for 
designing subsequent operations in the livestock sector that are pro-jobs. In undertaking this task, 
the consulting firm would be assisted by the task team and the jobs GSG.

Lessons learned and client engagement
What problems did the task team encounter during implementations and what were 
some lessons learned? What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS 
scale up to more operations?
The problem the team encountered during implementation is the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
strict lock down that was declared following the outbreak. The team initially planned to recruit an 
international consultant who would lead the work with a support from a local consultant in the 
form of facilitating data collection, administrative arrangements etc. However, travel restrictions 
imposed following the strict lock down made this difficult. This in turn had forced the team to be 
flexible and look for alternative ways of getting the consultancy work done, including revising 
the TOR, shifting from using international consultant to using a local consulting firm, using 
digital technologies for the survey instead of a face-to-face etc. One of the lessons learned is 
to always be prepared for such eventualities and include elements of flexibility in the design 
and implementation of such activities. Using local consulting firms also plays an important role 
in building and enhancing local capacity hence needs to be promoted. 
What did the task team do to build capacity in client countries (including NGOs, CSOs 
and government agencies)?

As part of ensuring effective implementation of the jobs consultancy work, which is part and 
parcel of the parent (livestock) project, the team provided physical capacity building to the client, 
including procurement of digital and IT equipment and/or facilities, and transport facilities that 
facilitated on-line supervision, travel and follow up. The SEJLS fund did not directly finance any of 
these but rather benefited from them. The fact that the SEJLS fund financed a local consultant 
firm to do the job is also capacity building in client countries.

The COVID-19 crisis has a significant impact on (eco)tourism in Cambodia, thus additional support 
has been provided to the Royal Government of Cambodia in assessing the impact and recommending 
a way forward. 
Progress (as of December 2020)
Tasks in progress:
•	 The concept for the study on the economic impacts of ecotourism has been prepared and 
discussed with the client. 
•	 The socio-economic survey will collect baseline data on ecotourism related job and income-
generating activities. 
•	 The socio-economic survey, the study on economic impacts of ecotourism, and findings of the 
Enabling Ecotourism Development in Cambodia report will inform the definition of potential 
tourism-related skills training programs. 
•	 Ongoing support is being provided to the RGC to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the 
ecotourism sector and define ways forward also in terms of capacity needs related to WASH 
in the tourism sector. 
Tasks completed:
•	 Enabling Ecotourism Development in Cambodia report finalized and published: The report 
provides clear guidance to the Royal Government of Cambodia on what needs to be done to 
develop ecotourism development under the Cambodia Sustainable Landscape and Ecotourism 
Project. It provides insights into the importance of ecotourism as an economic driver in 
Cambodia, the legal frameworks involved with making it happen, who the tourists and the 
stakeholders are, and the challenges and barriers that have frustrated the development of the 
sector. Most importantly, it offers a set of strategic actions that, if implemented, could build 
the environment needed to allow ecotourism to survive this current challenge and also thrive 
going forward.
•	 Policy Note on Enabling Ecotourism Development in Cambodia has been drafted. 
Lessons learned and client engagement
What problems did the task team encounter during implementations and what were 
some lessons learned? What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS 
scale up to more operations?
Challenges and lessons learned:
•	 MoE’s capacity on livelihoods activities is rather low and the engagement with the private sector 
has been slow. Engaging with private sector partners and thinking outside the box in terms 
of value chains/products to develop are relatively new to the client and close accompaniment 
and by the task team is required to advance the activities and make use of the excellent 
recommendations provided by the 4P consultant. Recommendations need to be linked to close 
implementation support.

•	 COVID-19 has strongly impacted on livelihood and (eco)tourism activities in the country. While 
it has resulted in significant job and revenue loss, the pressure on natural and forest resources 
has increased. However, there is also increased attention and awareness of the potential of 
conservation compatible job opportunities in the recovery from the crisis, and our work is 
gaining momentum. 
What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS scale up to more 
operations?
It would be useful for the SEJLS team to support the exchange with other projects/activities, 
and to help to disseminate lessons learned and good practices (e.g. methodologies for M&E 
indicators, good practice in terms of responding to job loss during COVID-19). Ad-hoc support 
in the review of ToR, reports, etc. is useful, but learning and dissemination of resources could 
be made available to a larger audience and reach more projects to benefit from SEJLS. 
What did the task team do to build capacity in client countries (including NGOs, CSOs 
and government agencies)?
•	 On COVID-19: The team worked to gather data and support the client with recommendations 
for interventions on ecotourism in the short- medium and long-term in the following areas: 
1. Governance, Regulatory and Organizational Measures; 2. Fiscal and Monetary Support; 3. 
Industry and training support; 4. Destination and Products Development; 5. Tourism Branding 
and Marketing; 6. Improving Health, Hygiene, Sanitation and Service Delivery.
•	 The work on ecotourism has been very collaborative, engaging development partners, NGOs 
and the private sector. Not only has this helped to foster the ownership of the recommendations 
by the client but has also built the capacity of government staff in better understanding the 
needs and requirements of the partners in the sector. 
•	 Particularly the 4P consultant has engaged very closely with the client and the private sector, 
aiming to map needs and expectations. Several roundtable discussions, presentations and 
workshops have been held to raise awareness and strengthen the client’s ownership of 
this activity.

The objective of this activity is to support jobs and livelihood of populations in Tajikistan through 
tourism development. 
The activity supports training and capacity building activities to complement the REDP grants for 
community-based infrastructure, matching grants for tourism-sector MSMEs, and rehabilitation 
works on tourism sites to create jobs and improve worker skills in Khatlon and GBAO. 
Timeline 
The activity has started from August 1, 2020 and is expected to conclude December 31, 2021. 
The REDP was declared effective on July 1, 2020. The COVID-19-related crisis has caused travel 
restrictions to Tajikistan and a sudden-stop in tourism activities in the country. The crisis and 
associated travel/work restrictions also caused a delay in the implementation of REDP. 
Progress (as of December 2020)
A report with concrete recommendations to support tourism sector jobs and skill development 
has been drafted. As part of the report, an implementation roadmap including the detailed terms 
of reference for consultants to implement the recommendations in the report has been drafted. 
The capacity building activities include, inter alia, (i) astro-tourism development, (ii) tourist guide 
training, (iii) handicrafts market development, and (iv) hospitality and construction sector trainings. 
The activities envisaged under the report will complement REDP’s grant and matching grant program

continue working with the authorities around (i) improvements to the afterschool program “Let’s 
do Homework,” based on findings from the World Bank assessment, including on monitoring and 
evaluation systems; (ii) organization of a workshop on international practices in early childhood 
development, with a focus on childcare services for children ages 0–6, and (iii) Organization of 
knowledge exchange activities with EU countries on differentiated childcare supply modalities, 
including coverage of public and private daycare services. The results of this activity would naturally 
feed into future Bank operations as a follow-up.

For (1) the closure of schools during the 2019–2020 school year automatically canceled any after 
school activities and authorities had to direct all their attention to delivering education under a 
“distance learning” model for which they were not prepared. During the present year, as COVID‑19 
infection rates continue to be relatively high, after school programs are not taking place. The team is 
reaching out to the Ministry to understand whether there is a timeline to reopen and how to think 
about such plans, and whether expanding is an option under current conditions. 
Regarding (ii) and (iii) the team is expecting contact at the subnational levels to resume but remote 
connections have been difficult. The team is considering a few online resources, which would be 
ready to be delivered to the authorities during 2021, depending on the conditions.
Lessons learned and client engagement
What problems did the task team encounter during implementations and what were 
some lessons learned? What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS 
scale up to more operations?
Aside from the difficulties associated to launching new activities in a context of no travel and 
only VC meetings, there have been no unusual issues related to SEJLS. The approach followed 
by the Jobs group to identify selectively champion projects was very effective to deploy the 
resources relatively quickly; however, to gain even more impact the team may want to consider 
helping teams at early stages of dialogue (perhaps even during ASA completion) to have a 
greater impact on the preparation process, which is typically underfunded. 
What did the task team do to build capacity in client countries (including NGOs, CSOs 
and government agencies)?
Over the years, the team benefited from a UFGE TF that allowed to generate vast knowledge 
and many exchange events, this is what led to the definition of the reform program behind the 
Gender DPO.

TURKEY
AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT FOR REFUGEES AND TURKISH 
CITIZENS THROUGH ENHANCED MARKET LINKAGES
P171543
Development objective
Improving the conditions to create formal employment opportunities in rural areas of selected host 
communities.
Grant Activity 1
On the supply-side (workers), the assessment will identify current constraints among refugee 
workers in accessing better employment opportunities in and outside agriculture. The assessment 
will identify employment preferences of refugee workers along several dimensions of job 
attributes, and weight those job attributes against the social benefits refugees can receive in the 
absence of a formal work activity. The assessment will also collect information on other potential 
constraints faced by refugees in accessing better employment opportunities in the agricultural 
sector, which could include a lack of technical or language skills, issues related to job search and 
intermediation, limited geographical mobility, or legal constraints associated with refugee status, 
among others. The findings of the supply-side assessment will directly inform the design of the 
project Agricultural Employment Support for Refugees and Turkish citizens through Enhanced 
Market Linkages—(P171543). It will also inform the design of another operational project on the 
integration of refugees in the urban labor markets of Support for Transition to Labor Market for 
People under Temporary and International Protect—(P171471). Finally, it will inform the Emergency 
Social Safety Net (ESSN) exit strategy of the Turkey government for Syrian Refugees, which aims 
at facilitating the transition from the emergency cash transfer system for refugees into labor 
market activities.
On the demand-side (farmers), the activity will assess the willingness of farmers to hire workers 
formally depending on potential workers’ attributes and the extend of labor cost subsidization 
provided by the project. The activity is expected to take the form of a field experiment in the 
form of an auction experiment carried out among farmers in provinces targeted by the project. In 
particular, the field experiment would assess the willingness of farmers to formally hire workers 
depending on workers attributes (e.g. Refugee worker versus native worker) and alternative 
wage subsidy amount The results of this sub activity will inform the design of the supply-side 
interventions as part of the Agricultural Employment Support for Refugees and Turkish citizens 
through Enhanced Market Linkages—(P171543), in particular the design of the subsidy subsidizing 
labor costs. 
Deliverables: Technical background paper on supply-side assessment—Technical background paper 
on demand-side assessment.

•	 April 2021: DCE data collection concluded
•	 May 2021: survey dataset available and farmers’ field experiment concluded 
•	 September 2021 (expected completion date): supply and demand-side assessment drafted 
These timelines are consistent with the timeline set out in the GFR. However, the data collection 
methods used for the activities in this component may be revised in light of the containment 
measures and travel restrictions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Progress (as of December 2020)
On the supply-side, the team has agreed on the methodology to carry out the supply-side 
assessment. It was agreed that a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) administered to refugees in 
the field is the best instrument to assess employment preferences of refugee workers. A series of 
hypothetical employment choices with differing attributes randomly manipulated will be provided 
to respondents (e.g.). Choice problems will be designed to reflect uncertainty (for example, 
there is a risk of not being able to find informal employment during a season) as well as dynamic 
considerations (SuTP’s will lose ESSN benefits permanently once they accept a formal job; making 
it salient that the ESSN is not a permanent program, etc.). Piloting and focus group discussions will 
be used to determine which attributes are important to the local context as well as their appropriate 
levels, implying that the choices can be detailed further before implementation. In addition to the 
DCE, the field survey will also collect detailed demographic and background information on refugee 
workers, so that work preferences can be linked to refugee workers observable characteristics. The 
survey instrument for the activity is currently being drafted.
On the demand-side, the team has agreed to use a lab-in-the-field experiment design. The team 
defined the objectives of the lab experiment which will be twofold: (i) to assess preferences 
farmers’ preferences in hiring agricultural workers as well as (ii) price elicitation to determine the 
optimal level of subsidy for the project. In the first stage of the experiment, the team will test for 
potential statistical and taste-based discrimination in the hiring of refugee and Turkish workers by 
experimentally varying workers’ ethnicity and productivity. In the second stage of the experiment, 
In Stage 2, the wage subsidy will be introduced and experimentally varied to assess its impact on 
the number of workers hired by farmers by ethnicity. 
As next steps, the team needs to finalize the lab-in the-field experiment method to be used to elicit 
preferences and prices which will either be an auction mechanism, or the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak 
(BDM) preference elicitation mechanism. The team will also assess the adequate amount of 
compensation to be provided to farmers to participate in the experiment and where the experiment 
should be carried out to maximize participation. Finally, the team will determine whether the pay-offs 
to farmers resulting from the experiment will be tied to the actual project and whether they would 
be restricted to the experiment itself.

Grant Activity 2 
The activity will design a pilot intervention that addresses one of the market failures/constraints 
to formal employment creation for refugees identified by the assessments. Based on preliminary 
evidence from the field to be confirmed by the assessment, this activity could consist in designing 
a matching methodology/algorithm for formal rural employment to maximize the welfare of both 
workers and employers. The activity will also propose a Theory of Change based on market failures 
identified by the assessments then linking them to the results chain, and finally describing the main 
features of the economic analysis. 
Deliverables: Note on proposed pilot intervention to address demand-side or supply-side constraint 
to refugee formal employment—Theory of Change—Economic Analysis
Timeline 
September 2021 (expected completion date): note describing the design of the pilot intervention drafted.
Progress (as of December 2020)
Assessment activities to serve as input for the pilot intervention defined. However, further work on 
the pilot design will be based on the outcome of activity 2. 
For the theory of change—economic analysis, the team has drafted an economic analysis for the 
overall project. The next step is to share it with the jobs group for review and comments to move 
towards finalization.
Lessons learned and client engagement
What problems did the task team encounter during implementations and what were 
some lessons learned? What can be done differently in the future to support SEJLS 
scale up to more operations?
To date, the task team has been able to carry out the proposed tasks well, working within the 
task team, in consultation with local academics in Turkey. To date, no issues have emerged. 
What did the task team do to build capacity in client countries (including NGOs, CSOs 
and government agencies)?
The intention is to carry-out the proposed activities in close collaboration with the Agricultural 
Credit Cooperative, which is implementing the project, so that they can both help coordinate 
the relevant activities but also learn about the methods used and approach to this research, 
with the aim of building their knowledge and experience.

UPPER EGYPT LOCAL DEVELOPMENT PFORR
P157395
Development objective
To improve the business environment for private sector development and strengthen local government 
capacity for quality infrastructure and service delivery in select governorates in Upper Egypt.
Grant Activity 1
Baseline: Analysis of jobs across governorates and districts of Upper Egypt. This activity will prepare 
a mapping of jobs across governorates and districts of Upper Egypt.
Timeline 
Implementation start date: August 2020
Expected completion date: December 2020
Progress (as of December 2020)
The first part of analysis under this activity has already been completed. We have produced a 
note clearly outlining the key constraints faced by firms in the Upper Egypt region and other 
lagging regions using the WB Enterprise Survey. The data show that “Southern Upper Egypt” 
(which includes those governorates being supported by the Bank-financed Program) and “Frontier” 
regions of the country clearly come out as two lagging regions where firm constraints are reported 
as very different, especially compared to leading regions of the country such as Greater Cairo 
metropolitan region.
We are now launching a short analysis on productivity and lack of agglomeration economies in 
the region, where we will try to identify and distill key issues related to agglomeration economies 
including the extent of these economies and congestion costs, potential causes of the problem 
and estimate how governorates are delivering productivity. For this we plan to use the Economic 
Census and Labor Force Survey.
Grant Activity 2
Describe in detail this activity supported by SEJLS:
Local market failures: Analysis of local market failures in Upper Egypt. This analysis will aim to 
answer the question of whether public policies are incentivizing capital-intensive economic activity 
or labor-intensive economic activity, with the latter expected to create more jobs. We expect that 
there are several incentives for local firms to buy more equipment but not to hire more labor. We will

look into the skills level of labor in Upper Egypt and skills currently required by businesses there. We 
will also conduct a primary survey of firms in local clusters as well as existing and potential firms 
currently located in, or interested in locating in industrial zones in Upper Egypt. This will provide 
firms’ views on local job creation and help identify viable policies and investments. This survey will 
also cover how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted local firms, especially their labor 
force and its employment status.

Expected Start Date: December 2020
Expected Completion Date: March 2021
Progress (as of December 2020)
Not started yet. We are currently drafting Terms of Reference for experts to conduct these 
assessments and identifying the relevant experts.
Grant Activity 3
We plan to merge Grant Activity 3 and 4 into one, given their clear linkage.
Grant Activity 3: Recommendations: A note on spatially-aware interventions for job creation in Upper 
Egypt; and
Grant Activity 4: Guidance note on measuring jobs: A guidance note on measuring jobs indicators 
linked to urban and territorial development interventions
This note will focus on how to reduce cost of labor rather than cost of capital for Upper Egypt 
businesses, to enable them to hire more labor. We will try to identify policies / ways to subsidize 
activities to reduce the cost of labor for firms, to give firms an incentive for labor intensive activity. 
We will also try to identify policies and interventions which help the Upper Egypt region leverage its 
endowments and promote local economic development. We will also aim to measure the number 
of sustainable jobs created by private sector in firms that have benefited from interventions of 
the Bank-financed Upper Egypt Program, and how the Program has helped reduce market and 
coordination failures to enable future job creation. We will not necessarily focus on jobs created 
during project implementation by construction type activities as these may be temporary.

ANNEX D: 
PROGRESS REPORT ON ACTIVE GRANTS
TF0A2832 | Improving Jobs of Smallholder Women Farmers 
COUNTRY / REGION: Mozambique 
TTL: Joao H. C. Montalvao Machado 
GLOBAL THEME(S): Gender 
OBJECTIVE:
To identify, through rigorous research, effective policies to address underlying economic and social 
gender inequality in Africa and increase the take-up of these policies by the Government and the 
private sector. The grant shines light on constraints hindering women farmers’ technology adoption, 
access to markets, and entrepreneurship. Using a RCT approach, this project develops, implements, 
and rigorously measures the impact of two training interventions in the context of a feeder road 
rehabilitation program led by a WB project in Tete province, Mozambique. An agricultural extension 
program provides training on best farming practices and basic agribusiness skills (“hard skills”) 
through group sessions on demo plots and individual mentoring visits. A psychology-based personal 
initiative training teaches women farmers to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset focused on pro-
activeness, future orientation, and perseverance (“soft skills”). The study provides evidence on the 
effectiveness of these interventions and how they interact with improved rural road infrastructure. 
APPROACH: 
This grant-funded design and implementation of two training interventions targeted at female farmers 
in the context of a feeder road rehabilitation program led by WB project in Tete province, Mozambique. 
The impacts of these interventions are being evaluated using a rigorous RCT approach. The study 
comprises 2,240 women in 112 villages located along three feeder roads in Angonia, Macanga, and 
Tsangano districts. Two of these roads were selected to be rehabilitated under a WB-funded project. 
The rehabilitation work took place between February, 2017 and December, 2019. The villages are 
equally distributed along the three roads. Along each road, half of the villages are located 0–2 km away 
from the road, and the other half are located 2-10 km away from it. Within each village, 20 female 
farmers were randomly selected to participate in the study. The villages were randomly allocated to 
three groups. The first group comprised 37 villages (740 women) receiving an agriculture extension 
program. The second group comprised 38 villages (760 women) receiving both the agriculture 
program and a psychology-based personal initiative training. The third group comprised 37 villages 
(740 women) receiving neither intervention, serving as a comparison group. The random assignment 
of the villages across the three experimental arms was stratified by road, distance to the road, and 
the terciles of village average agricultural yields (estimated using the baseline household survey data).
Households and villages were first surveyed in February to June 2016 (baseline) on the agricultural 
season of 2014/2015. The same households and villages were interviewed again (i) in February through 
A N N E X  D

## Page 100
April 2019 (first follow‑up) on the agricultural season of 2017/2018, during which the interventions
took place; and (ii) September through November, 2019 (second follow‑up) to collect information on
the agricultural season of 2018/2019.
PROGRESS IN 2020:
Throughout 2020, the research team has finalized the data analysis to measure the impacts of
the two training interventions. Results show that the Personal Initiative (“soft skills”) training
fostered entrepreneurship outside the farm: doubling the share of women running profitable off
farm businesses, generating important additional source of income to the households.We also find
that Personal Initiative training enhance the effectiveness of agricultural extension (“hard skills”)
intervention: leading to large increases in area cultivated and adoption of fertilizers, pesticides, good 
farming practices (such as crop rotation and mulching) and cash crops (including soy), generating 
greater overall value of harvest and value of harvest sold. Importantly, we also find that household
expenditure goes up, and results persist after interventions have left the field.The team is currently
drafting a policy brief and an academic paper and will focus on disseminating the results. 
LESSONS LEARNED:
• Results show how a psychological mindset training targeted to women farmers can lead to 
greater investment and entrepreneurship, helping their households transition out of subsistence 
farming and into market‑oriented agriculture and off farm businesses.
• The results also suggest the promise of psychology to improve the design and effectiveness
of standard agricultural extension programs, showing the importance of teaching not only best 
production technologies and practices, but also developing an entrepreneurial mindset.

together diverse stakeholders, and using knowledge to achieve high-impact programming for youth 
employment at scale. Generate key knowledge and partnership products that provide a shared and 
common platform of metrics and knowledge on youth employment.
APPROACH:
Continued support of the S4YE partnership and board, supplemented with building of new private 
sector partnerships. Leveraging financing for greater learning will include co‑sponsorship of the
development of global goods, large‑scale networking, and dissemination events. Grant‑financed
activities include preparation of the S4YE flagship report on youth employment; the first interim
annual S4YE report with thematic focus, plus toolkits for practitioners; and content development
for the S4YE website (http://www.s4ye.org).
PROGRESS IN 2020:
This year the team further scaled up S4YE activities across all pillars of the work program, in spite 
of challenges due to COVID. The team produced two solid thematic notes on topics that were not 
addressed as much within theWBG.The first note was on Job creation in the Orange Economy and
the second was Digital Jobs for Youth with Disabilities. The note on disabilities also brought together 
a unique group of WBG teams and external partners, including the Global Disability Advisor team 
in SSI GP.The team also led two MDTF Solutions Notes on Digital Jobs forYoung Women and Jobs
for Young Syrian Refugee Women. The team updated the Knowledge Repository of tools for youth 
employment practitioners adding several new theme, such as on green jobs, disabilities, and jobs in
agriculture. This repository has become a go-to place for practitioners. The team also led a monthly 
series of very successful and well attended webinars bringing in new ideas and innovations from 
outside the Bank-to-Bank teams. Our monthly newsletters with crisp summaries of new reports, 
events, among other things, have been well appreciated. The team also successfully supported 
several WBG operational teams bringing in the digital jobs agenda to operations in Ethiopia, Iraq,
Cambodia, Lebanon, Sierra Leone, and other countries. S4YE partnered with different GPs in all
activities especially with Social, SPJ, Education, DD, Agriculture, FCI, and also scaled up partnership 
with IFC’s team on education/digital skills.
LESSONS LEARNED:

TF0A4831| Impact Evaluation of South Africa Youth Job Search Assistance 
COUNTRY / REGION: South Africa 
TTL: Eliana Carranza 
OBJECTIVE:
To examine the role of labor market frictions in private sector development in South Africa. This 
research will specifically contribute to understanding the implications of imperfect information for
labor market screening, firm productivity, and growth.
A N N E X  D
93


## Page 102
APPROACH: 
By testing ways to overcome information asymmetries, this evaluation will inform dialogue around 
effective interventions to boost private sector growth, firm labor demand, and employment. The 
evaluation will take place through approaches such as (i) designing an online platform with worker 
profiles, (ii) conducting qualitative interviews with firms to validate the platform design, (iii) identifying 
small and medium enterprise (SME) firms for participation in the study, (iv) piloting the online platform, 
and (v) collecting baseline survey data and platform-based monitoring data. 
The project team partnered with Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator to implement a 
work‑seekers study and firm study. The project uses a series of field experiments to identify how 
information sharing concerning work seekers’ skills changes the work seekers perception about their 
abilities and the labor market, as well as firms’ responses to their applications. The work-seekers study 
tests and provides work seekers with information about their own skills and aptitudes. Work seekers 
receive a certificate that allows them to credibly convey this information to prospective employers 
through a branded test certificate. Complementary to this intervention, the firm study identifies 
the effects of providing more information about candidates’ skills directly to firms. An interactive 
“Skillfinder” platform created and offered to firms contains more than 6,000 work seekers profiles and 
test assessments. The information provided to firms is randomly varied and therefore work seekers 
are randomly matched to jobs. 
PROGRESS IN 2020:
All data collection, data analysis, policy notes and dissemination activities planned for this period 
were completed. A working paper with impact evaluation results was produced and published in 
the World Bank Policy Working Paper Series, the Harvard Center for International Development 
(CID) Faculty Working Paper, Oxford University and Duke University Economic Research Initiatives 
(ERID). An implementation manual for the skill certification activities was developed with Harambee 
and published at the Jobs Group and Oxford. The manual is targeted to a more operational audience 
who may be interested in replicating the activities. Jointly with our partner JPAL a methodological 
note was also produced. The note summarizes best practices for surveying young and highly mobile 
work-seekers over the phone, which draws from experience with data collection for this and other 
projects (including two also funded by the Jobs MDTF). The note has been well received by policy 
practitioners. Impact evaluation results have been disseminated broadly to academic and policy 
audiences, both in South Africa and internationally. Two blogposts were prepared and published 
at VoxDev and GlobalDev (English, French and Spanish). Presentations were given at the BREAD 
conference, and AEA/ASSA annual meetings. 
LESSONS LEARNED: 
•	 Findings indicate higher employment rates, higher earnings, and more accurate beliefs about 
their skills among work seekers who received a skills certificate. The intervention does not seem 
to change work seekers’ search behavior (neither effort nor effectiveness), providing evidence 
of limited information frictions on the supply-side. Instead, demand-side information frictions 
exist and seem to be more quantitatively important for labor market outcomes.
•	 Our estimates of demand suggest that labor market service providers could at least partially 
finance their operations through payments from participating firms. Impacts were similar for 
male and female work-seekers and firm-owners.

• In bulk‑scraping multiple online job vacancies, our team noticed many misleading, questionable,
and low-information posts. These were eliminated in a careful curation process before 
implementation. Those posts included jobs with unrealistic salaries or unrealistic prospects,
jobs that required “training fees”, and multi‑level marketing jobs.The frequency of posts like this
was worrying and represents a search barrier to young inexperienced workseekers.
• The results also suggest the promise of psychology to improve the design and effectiveness
of standard agricultural extension programs, showing the importance of teaching not only best 
production technologies and practices, but also developing an entrepreneurial mindset.

TF0A4483 | Mexico Youth Labor Market Inclusion Pilot 
COUNTRY / REGION: Mexico 
TTL: Alvaro S. González 
OBJECTIVE:
To pilot and evaluate innovative approaches to improve employment outcomes for youth transitioning 
from school to the labor market.The project also supports linking labor market demand and supply by
decreasing firms’ job search and turnover costs.Targeted beneficiaries comprise low‑income youth
graduating from upper secondary school, including past and present beneficiaries of conditional
cash transfer programs.
APPROACH:
Contribute to government efforts through design, implementation, and IE of a multisectoral model
based on existing government programs. Project design is informed by a diagnosis study and a
thorough consultation process with federal and local government officials, NGOs working on youth
employment, targeted youth, business associations, and private sector firms. Project activities
include a labor market literacy workshop delivered at schools by the Public Employment Services 
office (SNE); an economic incentive delivered directly to project beneficiaries to promote access to,
and staying in, formal employment; and a remote‑based strategy to monitor and support take‑up of
project activities and high‑frequency tracking of youth’s trajectories.
The project is implemented in two phases. Phase I (MM 2018–MM 2019) tested implementation
mechanisms and validated potential hypotheses regarding youth constraints. Results from Phase I
informed project activity design improvements for Phase II (MM 2019–to date), which started
implementation in 2020. 
PROGRESS IN 2020:
Phase II began in April 2019 by collecting baseline data and delivering a labor market literacy
workshop at upper secondary schools by trained SNE staff. At the end of the workshop, a randomly
selected sample (970 youths) of targeted youth (total sample of 1,924) received an offer to obtain a
A N N E X  D

formal employment incentive (FEI) if they were able to provide evidence of formal employment and 
permanence in formal employment after graduating from upper secondary education. The stimulus 
was offered to selected youth regardless of their plans after graduation. The amount of incentive
offered was MXN 900 monthly (approximately US$ 45). The incentive is paid for up to six months,
as long as the participant demonstrates formal employment. The FEI intervention is ongoing. There 
is no deadline to claim the incentive, and youths who receive the offer can claim the incentive any
time after finding a formal job, for a single time (they cannot reapply once they have received it).
A total of 970 youth were randomized to receive the incentive offer, and 55% were planning at
baseline to search for a job after graduation. To date, out of those, 383 individuals have registered
to receive the incentive, 285 have self-reported being formally employed, 213 have received their 
first incentive payment, and 151 have completed six months receiving the incentive.
To reduce high rotation during the first six months on the job, the FEI was initially designed to be
paid for up to six months, continuously, as long as the participant demonstrated their permanence 
in formal employment at the same firm. However, in response to the COVID‑19 crisis and labor
market pressures introduced by the pandemic, the condition of staying at the same firm was relaxed
in March 2020. Now, it is only required that participants remain formally employed, regardless of
whether they had changed firms and whether this change occurred or not immediately after leaving
the previous job. The team informed about this modification by SMS to all individuals assigned to
the treatment group.
LESSONS LEARNED:
• Building trust and ensuring continuous communication with youth are crucial elements to ensure 
participation in active labor market programs.
• More than half of the students plan to work either full or half time after graduating from high 
school. Yet, few schools invest in providing labor market information to students
• More than 80 percent of students have work experience; however, most of that experience has
been in the informal sector

APPROACH:
Within the broader context of the Côte d’Ivoire Productive Safety Net project, the pilot focuses 
on “action learning” and development of rice value chain that includes smallholder farmers. The 
impact evaluation compared labor market and welfare outcomes attained through (i) a value chain 
development approach, (ii) cash transfers, and (iii) synergies from combing the two.
PROGRESS IN 2020: 
In 2019, smallholders received inputs on credit from a financial institution based on a contract with 
a rice mill to deliver a certain amount of rice, of a certain quality, at a fixed harvest price. The mill 
received working capital credit from the micro-finance institution to buy rice at harvest and followed 
up regularly with participating villages through a liaison agent hired at its own expense. The Jobs pilot 
paid coordination costs—including one agricultural liaison officer—invested in capacity building, and 
facilitated partners’ exchange (mill, farmers, local micro-finance branch) through local and national 
coordinators, and provided technical assistance to mills and agronomic advice to farmers. Participating 
partners carry the financial risks; no guarantee funds for loans nor subsidies for inputs are provided. In 
return, partners must offer all rice growers (with some form of water control), including the poorest, 
the opportunity to participate. 
The Jobs project team documented, evaluated, and communicated progress and lessons, and 
conducted administrative and household surveys about credit transactions, yields, and sales, as well the 
socio-economic profiles of about 550 participating and non-participating households from 52 villages 
around three rice mills in three regions (Tonkpi, Poro, Tchologo) in 2019. Evaluation revealed that while 
many did not generate a profit, some farmers demonstrated good results. But there were substantial 
implementation challenges, leading the partners to make program changes after year one, including 
limiting participation to farms with appropriate and sufficiently large lowland rice plots, streamlining 
provision of credit and reducing its cost, intensifying agronomic extension, and replacing a rice mill with 
another willing to offer a higher price. The second year, about 450 mostly new producers across 60 
villages participated. Although no partners made a profit (farmers, mills, bank), they made progress and 
most remedial measures had a positive effect. Use of machinery services also brought considerable 
benefits. Seed quality and COVID-related input delivery delays created liquidity challenges and reduced 
performance in two regions. The partners decided to undertake one more campaign adopting more 
changes, including tightening rules of participation, upfront payment of 10 percent of the credit as 
guarantee to ensure farmer commitment, and decentralizing decision making for credit provision and 
input purchases to the local consortia. Mills also received marketing strategy assistance. Early results 
from a new round of data collection showed that contracted “semi-lux” rice production was most 
profitable for mills, but it requires better quality paddy rice, greater contracted volume, and better firm 
management. Mills will be encouraged to introduce a quality premium. 
LESSONS LEARNED: 
Several lessons are emerging during implementation from the results of the first agricultural season 
the pilot accompanied:
(i)	
Moving from subsistence farming to market production applying modern inputs requires a 
long-term mentality shift. 
(ii)	 Agronomic support is key to increasing smallholder productivity and output quality.


## Page 106
(iii) Some water control is needed for commercial rice production; intensified rain‑fed production
is not profitable.
(iv) Rice marketing increases price (white rice), which in turn permits greater margin to mills and 
thus a higher price for farmers (paddy rice). 
(v)
Credit delivery models are not appropriate in a rural context, especially where farmers are 
not organized. 
(vi) While a contracting model can benefit all actors, it requires strong supply chain coordination
and participation of everyone. It takes time, collaborative spirit, and flexibility, as well as good
feedback loops to learn and adjust.
(vii) Distributing risks among all actors (including input providers) remains challenging.
(viii) Experiments including data collection, analysis and communication on value chain and 
contracts are crucial to generate evidence for policy dialogue. 
(ix) Insights from this project informed design of an IFC rice project in Côte d’Ivoire focusing on
a few large mills.

TTL: Federica Ricaldi 
GLOBAL THEME(S): FCV/Gender
OBJECTIVE:
To (i) promote creation of private sector jobs through a value chain–based approach, (ii) increase the
productivity of existing jobs, and (iii) help connect people to jobs.
APPROACH:
The grant finances four major components of the “Let’s Work Mozambique” work program:
(i) jobs diagnostic and input to policy dialogue, (ii) value chain analysis, (iii) job pilots, and (iv) a
knowledge-sharing platform for government, private sector, and development partner stakeholders.
PROGRESS IN 2020:
The project is wrapping up, with closing date May 31st 2021. In 2020, the grant funded the following
activities: (a) Jobs Strategy Note, (b) Value Chain Book, (c) Mozambique Aggregator Pilot final report
and (d) Biscate Study. The team will begin with dissemination of activities in 2021.

LESSONS LEARNED:
• It is crucial to keep the WB country management unit (CMU) and Donors informed about 
evolution of grant implementation and to ensure key stakeholder buy-in. 
• It is challenging to design a small pilot project. It takes time for the pilot to be designed in a way
that adds value to the CMU, the work of operational teams, and the broad analytical agenda. It 
may take time to determine best allocation of resources.
• While challenging and time consuming, it is important to integrate the project into other teams’
work. However, thanks to its quality and accompanying analytical work, the project has been
well received and has informed other work; for example, the Jobs Diagnostic, which was helpful
in designing a new operation on youth employment in Mozambique.
