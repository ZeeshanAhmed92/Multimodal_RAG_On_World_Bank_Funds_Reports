WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021
Introduction
MESSAGE FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT
This was a year dominated by COVID-19 and the ensuing global health and economic crisis. The pandemic 
has taken lives and disrupted livelihoods in every corner of the world. It has raised the urgency of mitigating 
severe economic impacts on poverty and overcoming the dangers of climate change, systemic inequality, 
social instability, financial risks, declining growth rates, and conflicts.
The World Bank Group‚Äôs ongoing response to the COVID-19 crisis has been massive and decisive, with trust 
funds and financial intermediary funds (FIFs) contributing to immediate relief initiatives and providing strategic 
support to countries as they rebuild for a resilient recovery. This report highlights the important work trust 
funds and FIFs are supporting to help shorten the crisis and lay a strong foundation for a future that is more 
prosperous and better prepared for disasters like COVID-19. 
Ongoing trust-funded activities are part of the World Bank Group‚Äôs efforts to build this foundation of greater 
resilience. Looking across the thematic areas of health, climate action, gender, social protection and jobs, 
and debt management, this report shows how trust fund and FIF resources‚Äîdisbursing $51.62 billion from 
fiscal years 2017 to 2021‚Äîsupport the World Bank Group‚Äôs goals to end extreme poverty and promote shared 
prosperity through greener, more inclusive and more resilient development. 
Trust funds and FIFs complement the core funding and activities of the World Bank Group, increase the scope 
and reach of its activities, and further its knowledge and learning agenda. They help address global and regional 
issues that transcend national boundaries and make it possible to support countries, such as non-members 
and those in arrears, where the World Bank Group cannot provide financing from its own resources. 
This report also examines how the World Bank Group brings value to trust-funded partnerships. Its convening 
power, at both the international and country level, optimizes coordinated action on shared development 
priorities to achieve impact at scale. Partners benefit from the World Bank Group‚Äôs extensive technical expertise, 
country experience and supervision capacity, and its ability to monitor and report on results. Ongoing reforms 
in trust fund and FIF management also ensure strategic alignment, efficiency, transparency, collaboration, and 
predictability in the use of resources. As part of the drive to enhance financial sustainability, new measures are 
also being implemented to recover costs in delivering externally funded activities.
Partnerships are at the core of trust fund and FIF success, and we thank all our development 
partners, implementing partners, and client countries for their engagement, 
collaboration, and dedication to our shared mission and vision. Our work ahead is 
more critical than ever. Together, we are building on forward momentum to generate 
a resilient recovery that ensures a broad and lasting rise in prosperity for all.

WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021
Introduction
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 
TOWARD GREATER RESILIENCE
The COVID-19 crisis has affected economies around 
the world and shocked every sector from health 
and the environment to education and jobs to the 
macroeconomy and government debt, to name just 
a few. The impacts of the pandemic have cascaded 
into developing markets and hit vulnerable 
populations especially hard. COVID-19 has severely 
disrupted access to many essential health services, 
particularly in the poorest nations with the most 
fragile health systems, and has spawned the worst 
crisis to education and learning in a century. Rising 
global inequalities, lagging progress in economic 
and social development, multiple prolonged violent 
conflicts, and increased forced displacement have 
all been exacerbated by the pandemic. Women and 
girls have borne the brunt of impacts at work and 
in the home.
The World Bank Group has mounted a broad 
and decisive response to the crisis‚Äîthe largest 
in its history. From April 1, 2020 through June 30, 
2021, the World Bank Group committed over $157 
billion, including $45.6 billion in financing from 
the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (IBRD) for middle-income countries, 
$53.3 billion in concessional financing and grants 
from the International Development Association 
(IDA) for the poorest countries, $42.7 billion from the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) to private 
companies and financial institutions, $7.6 billion 
in guarantees from the Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) to support private 
sector investors and lenders, and $7.9 billion for 
recipient-executed activities supported by trust 
fund resources (Figure 0.1).
iv
v
The World Bank Group‚Äôs crisis response has 
provided an opportunity to support a strong, 
durable recovery that tackles rising poverty and 
deepening inequality while addressing both the 
immediate devastation wrought by the COVID-19 
pandemic and the longer-term challenge of 
climate change. Green, resilient, and inclusive 
development, or GRID, is the Bank Group‚Äôs 
renewed and refocused approach to collective 
action on interlinking challenges. 
This Trust Fund Annual Report, Toward Greater 
Resilience, speaks to the many ways that trust 
funds and financial intermediary funds (FIFs) 
are contributing to the World Bank Group‚Äôs 
effort to help client countries respond to the 
ongoing health and economic crisis stemming 
from COVID-19 and recover without significant 
setbacks to their long-term development agendas. 
Covering July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 (fiscal year 
2021 or FY2021), this year‚Äôs report provides an

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
TOWARD GREATER RESILIENCE

The COVID-19 crisis has affected economies around
the world and shocked every sector from health
and the environment to education and jobs to the
macroeconomy and government debt, to name just
a few. The impacts of the pandemic have cascaded
into developing markets and hit vulnerable
populations especially hard. COVID-19 has severely
disrupted access to many essential health services,
particularly in the poorest nations with the most
fragile health systems, and has spawned the worst
crisis to education and learning in a century. Rising
global inequalities, lagging progress in economic
and social development, multiple prolonged violent
conflicts, and increased forced displacement have
all been exacerbated by the pandemic. Women and
girls have borne the brunt of impacts at work and
in the home.

The World Bank Group has mounted a_ broad
and decisive response to the crisis‚Äîthe largest
in its history. From April 1, 2020 through June 30,
2021, the World Bank Group committed over $157
billion, including $45.6 billion in financing from
the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) for middle-income countries,
$53.3 billion in concessional financing and grants
from the International Development Association
(IDA) for the poorest countries, $42.7 billion from the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) to private
companies and financial institutions, $76 billion
in guarantees from the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) to support private
sector investors and lenders, and $79 billion for
recipient-executed activities supported by trust
fund resources (Figure 0.11).

The World Bank Group's crisis response has
provided an opportunity to support a strong,
durable recovery that tackles rising poverty and
deepening inequality while addressing both the
immediate devastation wrought by the COVID-19
pandemic and the longer-term challenge of
climate change. Green, resilient, and inclusive
development, or GRID, is the Bank Group's
renewed and refocused approach to collective
action on interlinking challenges.

This Trust Fund Annual Report, Toward Greater
Resilience, speaks to the many ways that trust
funds and financial intermediary funds (FIFs)
are contributing to the World Bank Group's
effort to help client countries respond to the
ongoing health and economic crisis stemming
from COVID-19 and recover without significant
setbacks to their long-term development agendas.
Covering July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 (fiscal year
2021 or FY2021), this year‚Äôs report provides an
overview of the World Bank Group's trust funds
and FIFs totaling $40.24 billion in funds held in
trust as of June 30, 2021. The report focuses on
their core strengths, institutional efficiencies and
reforms, key results and impacts from the field,
and financial trends and analytics. Highlighted
activities illustrate the strong commitment and
support of contributing development partners
in addressing the development objectives of
client countries.

and provide technical assistance, advice, and 
training to build stakeholder capacity and enhance 
sustainability. Trust funds and FIFs also build on the 
World Bank Group‚Äôs convening power and global 
and local presence to bring value to clients.
In FY2021, the World Bank Group disbursed $3.82 
billion in trust fund resources (not including FIFs), 
the bulk of which, $3.57 billion, was disbursed by 
the World Bank (IBRD and IDA combined). Almost 
three-quarters of World Bank-disbursed trust 
fund financing, or $2.55 billion, went to recipient-
executed activities on the ground, representing 
approximately 5 percent of the World Bank‚Äôs total 
project disbursements. IDA-only countries were 
the largest recipients at 66 percent, followed by 
IBRD countries (17 percent), IBRD-IDA blend 
countries (7 percent), and the balance to global or 
regional activities. 
The World Bank disbursed the remaining $1.03 
billion in trust fund resources toward Bank-executed 
activities, including knowledge generation, analytical 
activities, and project implementation support. 
Over the past five years, trust fund disbursements 
for Bank-executed activities have represented 25 
percent of the Bank‚Äôs administrative expenditures, 
including 63 percent of total expenditures for 
advisory services and analytics (ASA). 
IFC Advisory trust funds are a small but critical part 
of IFC‚Äôs overall budget, and are used to build the 
capacity of private sector clients, especially in IDA 
countries. IFC trust funds increasingly support IFC‚Äôs 
Creating Markets Upstream approach to create 
bankable projects in the most challenging settings. 
IFC‚Äôs blended concessional finance trust funds are 
also an important and growing tool for creating 
markets and stimulating development. The strategic 
use of concessional funds for projects with high 
development impact can catalyze private financing 
that would not otherwise be available and support 
the creation of new markets.
World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs also 
support global public goods that help advance 
key development issues that transcend national 
boundaries, including climate change, fragility, and 
pandemic preparedness and response. Many FIFs 
look to the World Bank Group as an implementing 
partner of choice. Trust funds and FIFs also allow 
a broader pool of contributors, including non-
governmental entities, to channel funds toward 
World Bank efforts to enhance global public goods.
Moreover, trust-funded activities allow the World 
Bank Group to provide development resources 
to non-member countries, countries in arrears, 
and non-sovereign entities that cannot receive 
Bank Group financing. MIGA, for example, works 
with development partners to leverage its limited 
resources and to increase the risk appetite of 
private investors in challenging environments. 
By collaborating with development partners to 
establish specialized guarantee trust funds, MIGA 
mobilizes guarantee capacity in high-risk states 
affected by fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV), 
where its operations would be limited.
IBRD/IDA trust fund grants are also a critical 
financing source for investments and technical 
assistance for recipient-executed activities in FCV 
situations. In FY2021, about 50 percent of total trust 
fund disbursements for recipient-executed activities 
were made to FCV-affected countries, concentrated 
in five locations: Afghanistan, Sudan, West Bank and 
Gaza, Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo. Effective implementation of these 
activities is subject to the shifting circumstances on 
the ground in some of these countries.
TRUST-FUNDED ACTIVITIES 
HELP BUILD RESILIENCE 
Trust funds and FIFs are making important 
contributions to all three stages of the World Bank 
Group‚Äôs pandemic response: relief, restructuring, 
and resilient recovery. This report sheds light on 
the ways in which trust-funded activities are fast-
tracking funding to emergency needs, boosting 
support for the most vulnerable, and extending the 
World Bank Group‚Äôs reach to help countries around 
the world end the pandemic and emerge stronger, 
more united, more equitable, and more prepared 
for future challenges. By the end of FY2021, IBRD/
IDA trust funds had committed $1.13 billion to 248 
World Bank operations that are helping countries 
respond directly to the COVID-19 crisis. They are 
enhancing access to lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines 
and treatment, and keeping students learning and 
governments solvent, among many other actions.
As the Bank Group looks ahead with its GRID 
approach, it brings into focus progress already 
being made in strengthening resilience across 
systems and society. The report showcases results 
stories from the field that illustrate how, over the 
past five years, trust funds and FIFs have supported 
World Bank Group projects and programs in health, 
climate action, gender, social protection and jobs, 
and debt management‚Äîall essential building blocks 
for greater resilience.  
‚Ä¢ In Cambodia, the Health Equity and Quality 
Improvement Program (H-EQIP) Multi-Donor 
Trust Fund is driving reforms across the health 
sector that have helped to reduce the proportion 
of households vulnerable to high health care 
costs by 43 percent from 2015 to 2020.
‚Ä¢ In Colombia, funding from the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF) has played a  
critical role in reducing deforestation, conserving 
biodiversity, and fostering climate resilience in 
the Amazon, including piloting a community-
based approach to land-use planning that the 
Government of Colombia is scaling up across  
the Colombian Amazon.
‚Ä¢ In East Africa, the Umbrella Facility for Gender 
Equality (UFGE) has funded research and a pilot 
program that is showing how digital financial 
service providers can tailor their product  
offerings and marketing to attract more  
women in agriculture. 
‚Ä¢ In Zambia, the Girls‚Äô Education and Women‚Äôs 
Empowerment and Livelihood (GEWEL) Multi-
Donor Trust Fund is helping to expand the 
successful Social Cash Transfer Program, which 
seeks to reach 30 percent of the Zambian 
population and 50 percent of the poor by 2022.
‚Ä¢ In Georgia, ongoing engagement through the 
Debt Management Facility (DMF) had enabled 
the country to build a framework for greater 
resilience in government debt management, so 
that it was able to respond effectively when the 
COVID-19 pandemic shocked the economy.
‚Ä¢ In the Middle East and North Africa, funding 
from IFC‚Äôs MENA Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises (MSME) 2.0 Trust Fund and the 
Partnership for Resilient Efficient and Sustainable 
SMEs Facility supported the development of an 
interactive webinar series that is helping MSMEs 
increase their business resilience in the wake of 
the COVID-19 crisis.

combining existing IBRD/IDA trust funds, as well 
as establishing new programs. This has enabled the 
World Bank to mobilize resources more strategically, 
efficiently, and effectively to help client countries 
achieve their development objectives.
A new Cost Recovery Framework for IBRD/IDA 
trust funds was launched in FY2021. Building 
on the previous one, this framework is simpler, 
easier to communicate and more predictable. The 
new framework aims to support and maintain the 
budget 
sustainability, 
including 
implementing 
targeted efficiencies and economies of scale, and 
increasing cost recovery. The new framework also 
increases the recovery of the World Bank‚Äôs indirect 
costs associated with trust funds over time, while 
maintaining some level of contribution from the 
Bank in recognition of the partnership nature of 
trust funds. 
IFC has initiated a proactive and strategic review 
of its fundraising efforts and use of trust funds to 
ensure alignment with its 3.0 Strategy and Creating 
Markets Upstream approach in support of private 
sector investment opportunities. The trust fund 
reform process has centered around IFC‚Äôs new 
corporate Funding Needs Assessment (FNA), which 
has allowed IFC to streamline governance and align 
development partner fundraising with its strategic 
goals and ensure development partner funds are 
appropriately balanced with IFC‚Äôs resources. By the 
end of FY2021, the FNA was fully integrated into 
IFC‚Äôs annual budgeting process, thereby facilitating 
more 
focused 
strategic 
partnerships 
with 
development partners. 
The World Bank Group also began implementing an 
updated FIF Management Framework in FY2020. 
This is helping to increase upstream engagement 
with development partners and shape the dialogue 
around the continuum of financing instruments 
available to meet development objectives and keep 
aid fragmentation in check. Discussions around new 
proposals now systematically include consideration 
of building on the existing aid architecture, including 
existing FIFs. No new FIFs have been established 
since FY2018.

Introduction
READING THIS REPORT
This report and its accompanying volumes delve 
deep into the contributions of World Bank Group 
trust funds and FIFs during the past five years 
(FY2017‚Äì21). It has the following structure:
Chapter 1 explains institutional reforms and how 
trust fund programs add value to the World Bank 
Group mission and complement the work of its 
various arms. It examines how the Bank Group‚Äôs 
convening 
power 
and 
technical 
capacities 
strengthen international partnering initiatives to 
achieve collective goals more efficiently than one 
partner could achieve by itself. 
Chapter 2 looks at how trust funds and FIFs have 
supported the World Bank Group‚Äôs response to the 
COVID-19 crisis. Fast-acting and targeted trust-
funded activities have helped in relief, restructuring, 
and resilient recovery efforts to save lives, protect 
the poor and vulnerable, ensure sustainable 
business growth and job creation, and strengthen 
policies, institutions, and investments.
Chapter 3 takes a broader view to showcase how 
trust funds and FIFs have supported World Bank 
Group public and private sector efforts in health, 
climate action, gender, social protection and 
jobs, and debt management during the past five 
years. These themes illustrate the diversity and 
strategic value of trust-funded activities in building 
the foundations for greater resilience now and 
into the future. 
Chapter 4 provides financial information and 
analytics on the activities of World Bank Group 
trust funds and FIFs, as well as externally financed 
outputs. It examines five-year trends on trust 
fund and FIF inflows, outflows, and assets under 
management‚Äîall of which demonstrate the World 
Bank Group‚Äôs position as the partner of choice in 
advancing development agendas in countries, 
regions, and around the globe. 
2021 Yearbook of Trust-funded Results is a separate, 
complementary document that expands on the trust-
funded activities referenced in the report. It shines 
more light on development partner contributions, as 
well as the work of beneficiaries and stakeholders 
on the ground. 
Lessons from the Umbrella 2.0 Transition is a

Trust funds combine the advantages of multilateral 
aid (such as larger geographic presence, economies 
of scale, lower administrative costs, and proven 
implementation capacity) with those of bilateral 
assistance (targeted assistance in areas such as 
fragile situations where donors have limited or 
no presence). Trust funds can also bring down 
transactions costs and reduce the proliferation of 
bilateral programs. Channeling trust funds through 
multilateral institutions, like the World Bank Group, 
can also facilitate the integration of global priorities 
into country programs. 
1.1 VALUE PROPOSITION OF 
TRUST FUNDS
Trust funds support the achievement of the World 
Bank Group‚Äôs goals to end extreme poverty and 
promote shared prosperity in a sustainable way 
by providing financial resources, contributing to 
the knowledge agenda, and building on the Bank 
Group‚Äôs convening power and global and local 
presence to contribute to country, regional, and 
global development.
Trust funds complement core World Bank Group 
financing. Trust funds enhance global, regional, 
and country-level knowledge and provide targeted 
support to clients to complement the World Bank 
Group‚Äôs own financing. They fund nearly two-thirds

according to the provisions of the Bank 
Group‚Äôs Administrative Agreement with 
the donor(s) to each trust fund. Trust funds

of the World Bank‚Äôs analytical work and provide 
funding to pilot innovative ideas, support the quality 
and development impact of operations, and make it 
possible for the Bank Group to provide development 
resources to non-member countries, countries in 
arrears, and other institutions that cannot receive 
Bank Group financing.
Trust funds are used to mobilize development 
finance. For countries lacking the development 
finance to achieve their own goals, trust funds 
complement IBRD and IDA in helping governments 
build their capacity to mobilize revenue, manage 
public expenditure and public debt, and improve 
their procurement and public financial management 
systems. Trust funds support the development of 
innovative financial solutions and the mobilization of 
new, nontraditional sources of development finance.
Trust funds are used to address global and 
regional issues that transcend national boundaries, 
such as climate change, communicable diseases, 
and other shared challenges. Individual countries 
can be reluctant to borrow for county-level 
investments that contribute to the provision of 
global or regional public goods, the benefits 
of which transcend national boundaries. Trust 
funds facilitate assembling global and national 
stakeholders into partnerships to support the global 
aspects of public goods. For example, trust funds 
are helping to boost climate resilience by scaling 
up the implementation of renewable energy and 
energy efficiency measures. They are also helping 
to enhance countries‚Äô response to the COVID-19 
pandemic and preparedness for future pandemics.
1.2 WORLD BANK GROUP AND 
TRUST FUNDS
The World Bank Group consists of five institutions: 
the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (IBRD), the International Development 
Association 
(IDA), 
the 
International 
Finance 
Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International 
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes 
(ICSID). IBRD and IDA (collectively the ‚ÄúWorld Bank‚Äù)

administer the largest number of trust funds. IFC and 
MIGA manage fewer trust funds both in number and 
volume. IBRD also manages financial intermediary 
funds (FIFs)‚Äîtailored financing mechanisms that 
enable the international community to provide a 
coordinated response to global priorities.
IBRD/IDA TRUST FUNDS 
IBRD is the largest development bank in the world. 
It provides loans, guarantees, risk management 
products, and advisory services to middle-income 
and creditworthy low-income countries, and 
coordinates responses to regional and global 
challenges. IDA, the Bank Group‚Äôs fund for the 
poorest countries, aims to reduce poverty by 
providing zero to low-interest loans and grants 
for programs that boost economic growth, reduce 
inequalities, and improve people‚Äôs living conditions. 
As of June 30, 2021, the World Bank had 529 active 
trust fund accounts at the trustee level, into which 
donors make their contributions. The World Bank 
managing unit for each trust fund account disburses 
these resources to support either Bank-executed 
activities or recipient-executed activities. 
Bank-executed (BE) activities are performed by 
the World Bank, and constitute part of the Bank‚Äôs 
work program. Therefore, trust fund disbursements 
for BE activities are comparable to and contribute 
toward the Bank‚Äôs administrative expenditures. BE 
activities support the World Bank‚Äôs work over the 
entire range of the project cycle, from upstream 
activities (such as research, learning, and advisory 
services and analytics, or ASA) to country-level 
technical assistance and capacity building to support 
for project preparation, design, implementation, 
and impact evaluations (Box 1.1). In FY2021, trust 
fund disbursements for BE activities represented a 
quarter of the Bank‚Äôs administrative expenditures, 
including 63 percent of total ASA expenditures.
Ayesha Abeyratne / IFC
Recipient-executed 
(RE) 
activities 
support 
projects that are typically executed by country-
level recipients, similar to IBRD or IDA financing. 
Like IBRD/IDA projects, Bank staff appraise and 
supervise the projects to ensure that the recipients 
execute them in accordance with World Bank 
policies and procedures. The recipients who execute 
these projects are mostly sovereign governments 
or their agencies, as well as UN agencies or non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). Therefore, 
trust fund disbursements for RE activities form part 
of the Bank‚Äôs investment project portfolio. 
Trust fund support for RE activities enables the Bank 
to expand and complement its lending program 
in several contexts, such as situations of fragility, 
conflict, and violence (FCV) or when the Bank‚Äôs 
resources are limited by IDA‚Äôs assistance envelope 
or by the availability of IBRD‚Äôs lending resources. RE 
grants can also extend the Bank‚Äôs reach to countries 
in arrears, non-members (such as the West Bank 
and Gaza), and non-state recipients, such as civil 
society organizations (CSOs), which cannot receive 
direct funding through regular Bank instruments 
like IBRD loans or IDA credits and grants. They also 
complement IBRD and IDA in providing immediate 
assistance in response to emergencies, natural 
disasters, and countries dealing with an influx 
of refugees.
Trust-funded RE activities can either be stand-
alone grants or provide co-financing to projects 
being financed by the World Bank, IFC, FIFs, or 
other donor financing. In many instances the RE 
grants effectively lower the interest rate charged 
to borrowers. They are typically accompanied by 
trust-funded BE activities that support the Bank‚Äôs 
preparation, appraisal, and implementation of the 
RE grants. Trust-funded RE activities represented 
5 percent of World Bank disbursements to client 
countries in FY2021. 
Research activities increase understanding of the economic and social issues critical to the success 
of WBG operations, inform policy dialogue, and influence development thinking more generally. 
Knowledge products inform global engagements; share existing knowledge; establish World Bank 
and international standards, indicators, and various methodologies; and inform existing and new client 
engagements.
Advisory services and analytics (ASA) are services with an external client to inform the World Bank‚Äôs 
policy dialogue and engagement strategy with a country or specified audience (such as think tanks, 
academia, NGOs, development partners, governments, and the general public) and to stimulate public 
debate about development challenges and actions at a country, regional, or global level. ASA includes 
innovative, proof-of-concept, and pilot activities leading to the development of diagnostic tool kits that 
may be used in subsequent analytical activities.
Technical assistance helps strengthen the capacity of specific institutions and individuals involved in 
policy-making or managing investments to enhance project preparation, design, implementation, or 
the sustainability of project outcomes after a project has closed.
Bank-executed activities are part of the World Bank‚Äôs work program

Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships
IFC TRUST FUNDS
IFC advances economic development and improves 
the lives of people by encouraging the growth of the 
private sector in developing countries. IFC does 
this by creating new markets, mobilizing other 
investors, and sharing expertise‚Äîall of which help 
to create jobs and raise living standards, especially 
for the poor and vulnerable. Private investment and 
private sector solutions are essential to meet the 
World Bank Group‚Äôs twin goals of ending extreme 
poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity, 
especially given the longer-term economic impact 
of COVID-19.
IFC‚Äôs 
Creating 
Markets 
Upstream 
approach 
envisions a continuum of work, beginning with 
Advisory services (to help create the conditions for 
new investment through reform and development 
of promising business sectors) and continuing with 
support for developing specific projects in which 
IFC may invest.
Through Advisory programs, IFC works with 
clients, including companies, financial institutions, 
industries, and governments, to transform ideas into 
increased private sector investment, green growth, 
inclusive job creation, and bankable projects. IFC 
trust funds are the main instrument for financing IFC 
Advisory services, and increasingly its Upstream 
agenda, with funding coming from development 
partners, IFC, and its clients. While donor trust funds 
are an important contributor to delivery of IFC‚Äôs 
strategy, they account for a small portion of IFC‚Äôs 
total resources. 
Based on data for FY2020 and 2021, partner funding 
accounted for 13 to 15 percent of total annual 
resources. As of June 30, 2021, IFC had 158 active 
donor trust fund accounts, 54 percent of which were 
focused on IDA countries. IFC‚Äôs Advisory portfolio 
had 806 projects spanning 100 countries, with 
disbursements of more than $1.3 billion over the 
past five years.
IFC uses blended finance to crowd in private sector 
financing that would otherwise not be available. 
Relatively small amounts of concessional donor 
funds allow to mitigate specific investment risks and 
help rebalance risk-reward profiles of pioneering, 
high-impact investments so that these have the 
potential to become commercially viable over time. 
IFC takes a disciplined and targeted approach to 
blended finance governance, including following key 
blended finance principles for development finance 
institutions: rationale for blended concessional 
finance, crowding-in and minimum concessionality, 
commercial sustainability, reinforcing markets, and 
promoting high standards. 
IFC‚Äôs blended finance portfolio encompassed 20 
donor-funded programs at the end of FY2021, 
compared to 10 programs at the end of FY2017, with 
$1.45 billion in active contributions from 11 donors, 
including the IDA Private Sector Window.1
MIGA TRUST FUNDS
MIGA facilitates foreign direct investments into 
developing countries by providing guarantees 
(political risk insurance and credit enhancement) 
to investors and lenders. MIGA guarantees protect 
investments against noncommercial risks and can 
help investors obtain access to funding sources 
with improved financial terms and conditions. 
MIGA has two active trust fund accounts that help to 
expand its guarantee work in FCV countries where 
MIGA‚Äôs operations would otherwise be limited: the 
Conflict-Affected and Fragile Economies Facility 
and the West Bank and Gaza Trust Fund. These 
promote the stability and growth of FCV countries 
by catalyzing private capital flows from investors 
and financial institutions to these countries through 
the mobilization of political risk insurance products 
from both MIGA and the global political risk 
insurance industry.
1 As part of the 18th replenishment of IDA, the World Bank Group created a $2.5 billion IDA-IFC-MIGA Private Sector Window, to catalyze 
private sector investment in IDA-only countries, with a focus on FCV-affected states. The window became operational on July 1, 2017 
and is administered as a trust fund.
Going forward, MIGA plans to augment these 
two existing trust funds with two new trust 
fund 
accounts: 
one 
focused 
on 
renewable 
energy and another on advisory services to 
address the critical sustainability issues of 
governance, 
gender, 
and 
environmental 
and 
social compliance. All four trust funds will be 
brought under one coordinating MIGA Strategic 
Priorities Framework to ensure internal alignment 
and a consistent and coordinated approach.
FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY FUNDS 
FIFs are important tools in the development finance 
toolbox, offering customized financing platforms 
for partnership programs and special financing 
mechanisms that can catalyze a variety of public 
and private resources in support of international 
initiatives. 
The 
World 
Bank 
supports 
FIFs 
through tailored administrative, financial, legal, or 
operational services.
Most often launched at high-level, multilateral 
forums, FIFs enable the international community 
to provide a direct and coordinated response to 
global priorities. They serve as multi-contributor 
collaboration 
platforms, 
typically 
governed 
independently, that focus on providing large-scale 
pooled funding in support for global public goods, 
such as preventing communicable diseases, 
responding to climate change, and food security.
The World Bank manages a large and diverse 
portfolio of FIFs. It facilitates the establishment and 
operation of FIFs by offering to perform a set of roles 
and responsibilities tailored to the circumstances 
of each FIF. The World Bank is a valued partner 
as a trustee for FIFs, building on well-established

IFC TRUST FUNDS

IFC advances economic development and improves
the lives of people by encouraging the growth of the
private sector in developing countries. IFC does
this by creating new markets, mobilizing other
investors, and sharing expertise‚Äîall of which help
to create jobs and raise living standards, especially
for the poor and vulnerable. Private investment and
private sector solutions are essential to meet the
World Bank Group's twin goals of ending extreme
poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity,
especially given the longer-term economic impact
of COVID-19.

IFC's Creating Markets Upstream approach
envisions a continuum of work, beginning with
Advisory services (to help create the conditions for
new investment through reform and development
of promising business sectors) and continuing with
support for developing specific projects in which
IFC may invest.

Through Advisory programs, IFC works with
clients, including companies, financial institutions,
industries, and governments, to transform ideas into
increased private sector investment, green growth,
inclusive job creation, and bankable projects. IFC
trust funds are the main instrument for financing IFC
Advisory services, and increasingly its Upstream
agenda, with funding coming from development
partners, IFC, and its clients. While donor trust funds
are an important contributor to delivery of IFC‚Äôs
strategy, they account for a small portion of IFC‚Äôs
total resources.

Based on data for FY2020 and 2021, partner funding
accounted for 13 to 15 percent of total annual
resources. As of June 30, 2021, IFC had 158 active
donor trust fund accounts, 54 percent of which were
focused on IDA countries. IFC‚Äôs Advisory portfolio
had 806 projects spanning 100 countries, with
disbursements of more than $1.3 billion over the
past five years.

IFC uses blended finance to crowd in private sector
financing that would otherwise not be available.
Relatively small amounts of concessional donor
funds allow to mitigate specific investment risks and
help rebalance risk-reward profiles of pioneering,
high-impact investments so that these have the
potential to become commercially viable over time.
IFC takes a disciplined and targeted approach to
blended finance governance, including following key
blended finance principles for development finance
institutions: rationale for blended concessional
finance, crowding-in and minimum concessionality,
commercial sustainability, reinforcing markets, and
promoting high standards.

IFC‚Äôs blended finance portfolio encompassed 20
donor-funded programs at the end of FY2021,
compared to 10 programs at the end of FY2017, with
$1.45 billion in active contributions from 11 donors,
including the IDA Private Sector Window!

MIGA TRUST FUNDS

MIGA facilitates foreign direct investments into
developing countries by providing guarantees
(political risk insurance and credit enhancement)
to investors and lenders. MIGA guarantees protect
investments against noncommercial risks and can
help investors obtain access to funding sources
with improved financial terms and conditions.

MIGA has two active trust fund accounts that help to
expand its guarantee work in FCV countries where
MIGA‚Äôs operations would otherwise be limited: the
Conflict-Affected and Fragile Economies Facility
and the West Bank and Gaza Trust Fund. These
promote the stability and growth of FCV countries
by catalyzing private capital flows from investors
and financial institutions to these countries through
the mobilization of political risk insurance products
from both MIGA and the global political risk
insurance industry.

'As part of the 18" replenishment of IDA, the World Bank Group created a $2.5 billion IDA-IFC-MIGA Private Sector Window, to catalyze
private sector investment in IDA-only countries, with a focus on FCV-affected states. The window became operational on July 1, 2017

and is administered as a trust fund.

4 e WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021

Going forward, MIGA plans to augment these
two existing trust funds with two new trust
fund accounts: one focused on_ renewable
energy and another on advisory services to
address the critical sustainability issues of
governance, gender, and environmental and
social compliance. All four trust funds will be
brought under one coordinating MIGA Strategic
Priorities Framework to ensure internal alignment
and a consistent and coordinated approach.

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY FUNDS

FIFs are important tools in the development finance
toolbox, offering customized financing platforms
for partnership programs and special financing
mechanisms that can catalyze a variety of public
and private resources in support of international
initiatives. The World Bank supports  FIFs
through tailored administrative, financial, legal, or
operational services.

Sarah Farhat / World Bank

Most often launched at high-level, multilateral
forums, FIFs enable the international community
to provide a direct and coordinated response to
global priorities. They serve as multi-contributor
collaboration platforms, typically ¬© governed
independently, that focus on providing large-scale
pooled funding in support for global public goods,
such as preventing communicable diseases,
responding to climate change, and food security.

The World Bank manages a large and diverse
portfolio of FIFs. It facilitates the establishment and
operation of FIFs by offering to perform a set of roles
and responsibilities tailored to the circumstances
of each FIF. The World Bank is a valued partner
as a trustee for FIFs, building on well-established
financial, investment management, and accounting
platforms developed over the past two decades,
and on specialized legal and treasury services. In
addition, the World Bank often hosts FIF secretariats,
serves as an implementing entity for many FIFs, and
in some cases hosts an evaluation office (Table 111).

World Bank Group‚Äôs Roles and Services in FIFs during FY2021
TABLE 1.1
The World Bank served as limited trustee and/
or financial or treasury manager for 27 FIFs that 
were active during FY2021. Of these, the World 
Bank provided the legal personality for 19 FIFs, 
hosted the secretariats for 18 FIFs, and served as 
an implementing entity for 20 FIFs. The World Bank 
takes on an implementing entity role for most FIFs 
whose secretariat is hosted by the World Bank. The 
World Bank also acts as an implementing entity for 
three FIFs with external secretariats: Climate Risk 
and Early Warning Systems (CREWS), the Green 
Climate Fund (GCF), and the Guyana REDD+ 
Investment Fund (GRIF). Two FIFs were closed in 
FY2021: the Advanced Market Commitments (AMC) 
for Pneumococcal Vaccines and the Pandemic 
Emergency Financing Facility (PEF), reducing the 
total number of FIFs to 25 at the end of FY2021. 
FIFs financed a significant portion (28 percent) 
of total RE disbursements to project supervision 
by the World Bank over the last five years. During 
FY2017‚Äì21, the largest FIF contributors to Bank-
supervised RE activities were the Global Partnership 
for Education (GPE) ($1.22 billion), the Climate 
Investment Funds (CIF) ($0.98 billion), and the 
Global Environment Facility (GEF) ($0.75 billion).
The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program 
(GAFSP) launched its FY2020‚Äì25 replenishment 
cycle in October 2020, during which it received 
$300 million in pledges for the first year of the 
replenishment period, with the goal of receiving $1.5 
billion over the full replenishment period (Table 1.2). 
In June 2021, donors announced plans to commit up 
to $2 billion to CIF to support its new Accelerating 
Coal Transition initiative. Donors also pledged $4 
billion to the GPE at the Global Education Summit 
in July 2021.

EFFECTIVENESS THROUGH 
INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES
WORLD BANK
The IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio upholds the 
World 
Bank‚Äôs 
country-based, 
demand-driven 
delivery model, in which the Bank strives to 
achieve its developmental goals through activities 
at the country level, based on decisions made by 
sovereign country authorities. This requires deep 
and customized analysis of the economic and 
social conditions in each country, and a careful 
assessment of government priorities and of the 
Bank Group‚Äôs comparative advantage within 
each country.
The World Bank has realigned senior responsibilities 
within its Global Practices to strengthen links and 
cooperation between sectoral and regional teams, 
while maintaining the flexibility of the renewed 
delivery model. This is also expected to enhance 
contestability as well as the quality of the Bank‚Äôs 
knowledge products.

Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships
Increasing 
FIF 
selectivity 
and 
oversight. 
Since FY2020, early discussions have been 
held systematically with internal and external 
counterparts on the most appropriate mechanism 
for new high-profile initiatives. In each case to date, 
it has been agreed that there was no need for a 
new FIF, but rather, objectives could be achieved as 
well or better through alternative options, including 
existing FIFs.
Increasing information sharing. In line with the 
commitment in the FIF Management Framework to 
increase information sharing on the FIF portfolio, the 
Bank presented key developments at the Annual 
Meetings and Trust Fund Forum meetings in FY2020 
and 2021. This included sharing references to recent 
reviews and evaluations of FIFs and information on 
upcoming replenishments. This Trust Fund Annual 
Report maintains the Bank‚Äôs commitment to provide 
at least annual reporting on the FIF portfolio.
As part of this realignment, a large portion of the 
IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio has been remapped 
to the Regions. This move, along with the 
continuing efforts of operational business units to 
consolidate their trust funds into fewer Umbrella 
2.0 Programs (Section 1.4), is enabling the Bank to 
mobilize resources more efficiently and effectively 
to help client countries achieve their development 
objectives, 
including 
the 
17 
Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). Larger, consolidated 
programs have greater flexibility to be strategically 
aligned and responsive to country needs. The 
Bank will be able to integrate trust fund activities 
into its annual strategy and planning processes, 
intermediating the supply of trust fund resources 
managed by Global Practices, and ensuring this is 
informed by client needs garnered from the Regions‚Äô 
engagement with client countries.
A new Cost Recovery Framework for trust funds 
went into effect on January 1, 2021. Consistent with 
guidance from the Executive Board and feedback 
received from development partners and staff, this 
framework is simpler, easier to communicate and 
more predictable than the previous one. It aims 
to support and maintain budget sustainability, 
including implementing targeted efficiencies and 
economies of scale and increasing cost recovery. 
The new framework also increases the recovery 
of the Bank‚Äôs indirect costs associated with trust 
funds over time while maintaining some level of 
contribution from the Bank in recognition of the 
partnership nature of this instrument.
IFC 
Since launching its Creating Markets strategy in 
December 2016, IFC has embarked on a series of 
internal reforms that have strengthened World Bank 
Group collaboration while taking a more focused 
approach to market creation. IFC‚Äôs partners will 
play an increasingly important role, by providing 
funding to support sector transformation and 
capacity building and through blended finance. IFC 
is also changing the way it identifies partner funding 
needs and develops funding arrangements with 
development partners. 
In FY2020, IFC embarked on a trust fund reform 
process centered around a new corporate 
Funding Needs Assessment (FNA). It has 
streamlined governance to align development 
partner fundraising with IFC‚Äôs strategic goals 
and ensure development partner funds are 
appropriately balanced with IFC‚Äôs resources. 
By the end of FY2021, the FNA had been fully 
integrated into IFC‚Äôs annual budgeting process to 
ensure alignment with country strategies.
IFC‚Äôs new approach to fundraising for its trust 
funds works to ensure all aspects of the business 
are addressing key development challenges. This 
approach delivers a number of advantages: 
‚Ä¢ Enables more focused strategic partnerships  
and coordinated engagement with its 
development partners 
‚Ä¢ Presents a holistic view of IFC‚Äôs activities across 
various themes and regions to ensure alignment 
with partners‚Äô strategic priorities 
‚Ä¢ Improves collaboration with the World Bank 
‚Ä¢ Increases efficiencies in the areas of trust funds, 
particularly in preparing proposals for partners 
and in allocating funds
FIF MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
The World Bank updated its FIF Management 
Framework in 2019 in response to a number of 
issues arising from the rapid growth in the FIF 
portfolio from nine to 27 FIFs between 2008 and 
2018. This growth added to the fragmentation 
and complexity of the aid architecture, with some 
unintended consequences for clients. FIFs can also 
raise significant risks for the Bank in the different 
roles it plays and at various points in their lifecycles. 
The primary objective of the updated FIF 
Management Framework has been to raise 
awareness of the challenges of some FIFs in 
responding to calls for a collective response across 
the development community and to put forward 
more concrete actions to address them, including 
the following:
‚Ä¢ Strengthening FIF selectivity, in part, by providing 
a menu of options that the World Bank Group 
could support to respond to global calls for 
collective action and by reserving new FIFs 
for situations where there are no reasonable 
alternatives. 
‚Ä¢ Deepening application of a risk-based approach 
for approval of new and restructured FIFs and in 
relation to major changes during a FIF‚Äôs lifecycle.
‚Ä¢ Providing the World Bank Group‚Äôs Board with 
more regular information on FIFs, including 
new FIFs under development, FIFs that seek 
restructuring, and information on the FIF  
portfolio as a whole.
‚Ä¢ Clarifying the Bank Group‚Äôs expectations and 
accountabilities in FIFs, particularly as the host of 
FIF secretariats and as an implementing entity. 
In FY2020, the World Bank‚Äôs Development Finance 
Vice Presidency (DFi) led the implementation of the 
framework by working in close consultation with 
other Vice-Presidential Units throughout the Bank. 
This involved the following actions:
Policy amendments. The World Bank‚Äôs Board of 
Executive Directors approved a new Trust Fund 
Policy (OP 14.40) in FY2021 and Management 
will issue a series of policy documents for staff in 
FY2022 that will further support its implementation.
FIF directives, procedures, and guidance notes. 
Extensive work has been undertaken to translate 
the direction of the Management Framework into 
updated FIF directives, procedures and guidance, 
which will be formalized in FY2022.

well or better through alternative options, including
existing FIFs.

Increasing information sharing. In line with the
commitment in the FIF Management Framework to
increase information sharing on the FIF portfolio, the
Bank presented key developments at the Annual
Meetings and Trust Fund Forum meetings in FY2020

reviews and evaluations of FIFs and information on
upcoming replenishments. This Trust Fund Annual
Report maintains the Bank's commitment to provide
at least annual reporting on the FIF portfolio.

1.4 TRANSITIONING TO 
UMBRELLA 2.0 PROGRAMS
A 2017 review of the IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio 
revealed significant fragmentation, with about 70 
percent of the trust fund accounts contributing 
to only around 7 percent of the overall trust fund 
resources. The World Bank‚Äôs current reform of its trust 
fund portfolio through fewer and larger Umbrella 2.0 
Programs aims at delivering transformative solutions 
for client countries and for development partners 
through improved strategic alignment, increased 
efficiency, and enhanced oversight. 
Umbrella 2.0 Programs are more strategically aligned 
with Bank priorities and are expected to increase 
the use of development partners‚Äô contributions to 
achieve better outcomes for client countries. During 
FY2021, the World Bank continued the transition 
to Umbrella 2.0 Programs by consolidating, 
redesigning, rebranding, and/or combining existing 
IBRD/IDA trust funds, as well as establishing 
new programs.
ROADMAP TO A LESS FRAGMENTED 
TRUST FUND PORTFOLIO
The role of trust funds has evolved dramatically 
during the last few decades, and the World 
Bank has undertaken initiatives and reforms to 
promote continuous improvement in the efficiency, 
strategic alignment, and robust oversight of trust 
fund resources and the activities they support. 
Prior reforms had enabled significant progress in 
transitioning trust funds to World Bank operational, 
financial, and administrative controls, including 
implementation 
of 
the 
trust 
fund 
fiduciary 
framework, which is now fully mainstreamed into 
regular business processes. 
The current trust fund reform aims to reduce 
fragmentation of trust funds. Its cornerstone is 
organizing the trust fund portfolio around a limited 
number of Umbrella 2.0 Programs. These are 
strongly aligned with the World Bank‚Äôs priorities and 
seek to enhance the effectiveness of development 
Dominic Chavez / World Bank
resources by strengthening internal oversight and 
integration with the Bank‚Äôs strategy and planning 
processes while further reducing transactions costs 
for mutual benefit. 
The process to transition the IBRD/IDA trust fund 
portfolio to one based on Umbrella 2.0 Programs 
began in early 2020 following World Bank Senior 
Management endorsement of the reform vision‚Äî
the culmination of a three-year, Bank-wide effort to 
define the design and implementation of the trust 
fund reform. Through this transition, the Bank is 
reducing the number of IBRD/IDA trust funds from 
a fragmented portfolio of 529 trust found accounts 
to 72 proposed Umbrella 2.0 Programs.
Each of the World Bank‚Äôs Global Practices and 
Regions prepared ‚Äúroadmaps‚Äù in FY2020 to identify 
a future trust fund portfolio architecture that would 
support strategically driven fundraising for their 
objectives and priorities. By the end of FY2021, 
72 programs were identified, of which 48 were 
confirmed to meet the Umbrella 2.0 Principles (Box 
1.2). The complete list of Umbrella 2.0 Programs is 
available in Annex C. 
The 
reform 
has 
benefited 
from 
extensive 
engagement with internal and external stakeholders 
and funding partners, generating many valuable

and opportunities. In FY2021, ‚ÄúDeep Dives‚Äù with 
donor agencies, consultations, and events at 
the World Bank‚ÄìInternational Monetary Fund 
(IMF) Annual and Spring Meetings and regular

KEY FEATURES OF  
UMBRELLA 2.0 PROGRAMS
Umbrella 2.0 Programs embody a flexible approach 
to trust fund organization and management that 
enables development partners and the World Bank 
to partner and finance mutual priorities. Designed 
to address the persistent challenge of a large and 
fragmented trust fund portfolio (many small funds 
with highly customized features), Umbrella 2.0 
Programs strengthen the link between funding and 
the strategic priorities of the World Bank, its clients 
and partners, and promote impact at scale. 
A trust fund portfolio grounded in Umbrella 2.0 
Programs means fewer, larger, more strategically 
aligned funding initiatives. The umbrella architecture 
also upholds the Bank‚Äôs country-based, demand-
driven delivery model and takes advantage of recent 
corporate realignments that deepen coordination 
between World Bank Regions and Global Practices.
Each Umbrella 2.0 Program is anchored by a primary 
multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) and, in some cases, 
may include associated trust funds (Figure 1.1). In 
all cases, the anchor MDTF and the associated 
trust funds retain common governance, results 
framework, and reporting in the new umbrella 
program. The anchor MDTF is a programmatic 
trust fund with a relatively broad thematic or 
geographic scope. 
Umbrella 
2.0 
Programs 
offer 
options 
for 
development partners who are interested in 
supporting a specific theme or geographic area. 
These options can accommodate situations where 
development partners are unable to contribute 
to the main MDTF due to their internal policies 
or regulations that require dedicated financial 
reporting to track their contributions. Such situations 
are handled by establishing separate associated 
trust funds, which support activities within the 
geographic and thematic scope of the umbrella. 
The overarching development objective of an 
Umbrella 2.0 Program is that of the anchor MDTF. 
An Umbrella 2.0 Program can be global, regional, 
or single country in scope and can support one 
or more priority areas of a World Bank Global 
Practice or Region as set out in its business plan. 
Associated trust funds support the Umbrella 2.0 
Program development objective and contribute to 
the overarching results framework of the Umbrella 
2.0 Program. They have a thematic and geographic 
scope that is within the scope of the anchor MDTF.
Umbrella 2.0 Programs provide scale and efficiency while working with 
development partners‚Äô requirements
FIGURE 1.1
Umbrella 2.0 Programs provide scale and efficiency 
for enhanced development impact and effectiveness, 
by offering the following benefits:
A more strategic way to partner with the 
World Bank and to finance priorities. Umbrella 
2.0 Programs offer an approach to organizing and 
managing trust funds in support of one or more 
shared strategic priority areas. Their broad scope 
and clear strategic focus elevate the dialogue with 
partners around shared priorities and mutually 
desired outcomes, while accommodating partners‚Äô 
interests and aligning with the World Bank‚Äôs 
planning and budgeting framework.
Increased access to the World Bank‚Äôs Senior 
Management in the context of high-level policy 
and strategy dialogue. Umbrella 2.0 Programs 
provide greater opportunities for development 
partners and the World Bank to work together 
strategically and efficiently and deliver better 
results for clients. A single governance structure 
for all funds in a program brings the World Bank‚Äôs 
Senior Management and partners to the same 
table around common development objectives, 
helps avoid fragmentation of resources, and 
increases efficiency. 
Opportunities to collectively address global 
and local development challenges and achieve 
meaningful results at scale. Through participation 
in the Partnership Council, development partners 
review progress against the unified results 
framework; provide strategic advice on setting 
priorities, including adjusting to changes in the local 
or global context; and collaborate in and benefit 
from knowledge-sharing activities. This strategic, 
program-level dialogue allows the World Bank and 
partners to work together to help advance policy 
dialogue and to ensure that individual activities are 
aligned around common outcomes. The Partnership 
Council endorses the Umbrella 2.0 Program‚Äôs 
annual work program and budget after which 
the World Bank allocates program resources to 
individual activities.

Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships
2 In some limited circumstances, the Bank may establish stand-alone trust funds (outside of umbrella programs), for example, to  
co-finance an IBRD or IDA project, or when it would not be possible or practical to channel donor resources in an umbrella as 
determined by Management. See, for example, the Cambodia Health Equity and Quality Improvement Program on page 37.
Improved narrative and results reporting and 
greater attention to communications and visibility 
for development partners. The Results Framework 
for each Umbrella 2.0 Program is developed in 
consultation with development partners. This covers 
activities funded by all trust funds in a program. 
The results framework is the key monitoring tool to 
assess how individual activities are contributing to 
a program‚Äôs overall development objectives. Results 
progress reporting is provided at the Umbrella 2.0 
Program level and may highlight contributions from 
associated trust funds in a comprehensive report.
Increased 
access 
to 
knowledge 
sharing 
opportunities on key development issues. 
Umbrella 2.0 Programs develop Communication 
and Visibility Plans (CVP) that are discussed with 
the Partnership Council. The CVP ensures that the 
strategic communication needs of each Umbrella 
2.0 Program are considered and implemented. 
This may include stakeholder analysis, audience 
segmentation, key messaging and channel selection, 
and how these can support the overall program 
goals and drive for results. The CVP also ensures 
appropriate branding of a program, participating 
development partners, and the World Bank.
STRATEGIC FUNDRAISING
The Strategic External Funds Framework (SEFF) 
exercise was launched in FY2021 to support Bank 
Management in furthering the evolution to a more 
strategy-driven approach to fundraising. The 
exercise consolidated progress made in the shift 
to a streamlined Umbrella 2.0 trust fund portfolio 
architecture and allowed for Management to review 
fundraising plans and ensure their alignment with 
priorities. Based on the plans laid out in the SEFF, 90 
percent of trust fund fundraising will be channeled 
through the proposed 72 Umbrella 2.0 Programs, a 
higher share than previously expected at this early 
stage in the reform implementation.2
The progress made on the Umbrella 2.0 Program 
rollout and enhanced management oversight of 
fundraising have made it possible for the Bank to 
avoid a moratorium on donor outreach for trust 
fund contributions during an IDA replenishment 
year, as had been the case in the past. This new 
Responsible Fundraising approach has ensured 
that IDA20 replenishment remains the top priority 
in 2021, supplemented by strategic trust fund 
fundraising plans complementary to and supportive 
of IDA and IBRD. Moving forward, the streamlined 
SEFF will be an annual management exercise 
for reviewing and updating strategic priorities for 
fundraising and authorizing changes in the trust fund 
portfolio architecture.
In parallel with the World Bank‚Äôs transition to 
Umbrella 2.0 Programs, IFC has undertaken a 
similar exercise designed to consolidate fundraising 
in trust funds that can house multiple projects 
and programs in a single, efficient administrative 
structure. The Facility for Investment Climate 
Advisory Services (FIAS), one of the World Bank 
Group‚Äôs oldest and largest multi-donor trust funds, 
is one of the key vehicles for IFC‚Äôs approach. FIAS 
supports IFC Advisory services that foster inclusive 
private sector growth in client countries, with a 
focus on IDA, fragile states, and Africa. 
During the FY2017‚Äì21 FIAS strategy cycle, 16 donor 
countries and organizations supported FIAS-backed 
IFC teams in helping to bring about 200 reforms 
that are making it easier to invest, start, and grow 
businesses in developing countries. More than half 
of these reforms took place in IDA countries, and 
about one-fourth were in FCV-affected situations. 
The strong working-level ties that IFC teams have 
developed with their clients paid dividends as the 
COVID-19 crisis unfolded and projects in the FIAS 
portfolio pivoted to meet urgent client demand.
Victor Idrogo / World Bank
During FY2021, the FIAS team updated its strategy 
for FY2022‚Äì26, with a pipeline of projects in support 
of IFC‚Äôs Creating Markets Upstream agenda. FIAS 
will be the fundraising vehicle of choice for IFC 
Advisory services projects at the preparatory end, 
what IFC calls ‚ÄúCreating Markets with Sector 
Interventions.‚Äù These involve sectoral or market-
wide interventions that will facilitate private sector 
investment and for which IFC could be a potential 
financing partner.
LEARNING FROM UMBRELLA  
2.0 PROGRAMS
The transition to a trust fund portfolio based on 
Umbrella 2.0 Programs is an iterative process that 
began in FY2019 with a handful of pilot programs. 
These have helped the World Bank to learn by 
doing and to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach 
in designing umbrella programs. The pilot phase 
has given way to the launch of full-fledged 
Umbrella 2.0 Programs. 
Table 1.3 features nine recently established programs 
that are implementing the Umbrella 2.0 principles, 
including governance arrangements, preferencing, 
results frameworks, reporting, and communications. 
Their implementation experiences offer lessons that 
can help guide the continuing transition process. 
These and other lessons from early Umbrella 2.0 
Programs continue to be collected to develop 
expanded knowledge-sharing activities.
Each of these programs began their Umbrella 2.0 
journey from a different starting point and each 
is at a different stage of implementation. The 
featured programs have diverse origins, including 
long-standing legacy programs, restructuring of 
existing programs, consolidation and mergers of 
existing programs, and new programs being built 
from scratch. Their objectives are well aligned 
with the GRID approach of green, resilient, and 
inclusive development. More insights are detailed 
in the accompanying Lessons from the Umbrella 
2.0 Transition.

for development partners. The Results Framework
for each Umbrella 2.0 Program is developed in

activities funded by all trust funds in a program.
The results framework is the key monitoring tool to

2.0 PROGRAMS

The transition to a trust fund portfolio based on
Umbrella 2.0 Programs is an iterative process that
began in FY2019 with a handful of pilot programs.
These have helped the World Bank to learn by
doing and to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach
in designing umbrella programs. The pilot phase
has given way to the launch of full-fledged
Umbrella 2.0 Programs.

Table 1.3 features nine recently established programs
that are implementing the Umbrella 2.0 principles,
including governance arrangements, preferencing,
results frameworks, reporting, and communications.
Their implementation experiences offer lessons that
can help guide the continuing transition process.
These and other lessons from early Umbrella 2.0
Programs continue to be collected to develop
expanded knowledge-sharing activities.

Each of these programs began their Umbrella 2.0
journey from a different starting point and each
is at a different stage of implementation. The
featured programs have diverse origins, including
long-standing legacy programs, restructuring of
existing programs, consolidation and mergers of
existing programs, and new programs being built
from scratch. Their objectives are well aligned
with the GRID approach of green, resilient, and
inclusive development. More insights are detailed
in the accompanying Lessons from the Umbrella
2.0 Transition,

Why development partners choose to partner with the World Bank Group 
through trust funds
BOX 1.3
1.5 BRINGING THE BEST 
OF WBG TO TRUST FUND 
PARTNERSHIPS
The World Bank Group contributes to trust-funded 
programs, such as Umbrella 2.0 Programs, through 
the partnership elements inherent in them. When 
the Bank Group engages as one of the partners in 
a trust-funded program, it is not simply a contractor 
for hire that provides services for the contributing 
donors. Rather, it brings all its institutional capacities 
to bear to achieve shared objectives more efficiently 
than one partner could achieve by itself. 
From the international coalition of development 
partners and clients that constitute the World 
Bank Group to engagement with UN agencies, 
international NGOs, foundations, and civil society 
to an increasing focus on leveraging private 
capital‚Äîthe World Bank Group has long recognized 
the transformative power of partnership where 
new ideas, perspectives, and experiences are 
combined with the necessary financial resources. 
Partnerships require more than financial resources 
to be successful; they need buy-in to legitimize the 
collaboration and advocacy that can extend their 
reach beyond the immediate partners.
Trust funds as a partnering mechanism have been 
in place for decades and have been instrumental 
in building upon the expertise and resources of 
multiple development partners and the World Bank 
Group. They are the most commonly used vehicle 
for funding partnerships in which the Bank Group, 
development partners, and other stakeholders work 
together to tackle a specific development issue or 
find new ways to approach problems at the global, 
regional, or country level (Box 1.3). Umbrella 2.0 
Programs are now becoming the primary way to 
partner with the World Bank through trust funds. 
A 2020 evaluation by the Independent Evaluation 
Group (IEG) found that trust funds and FIFs provide 
important convening opportunities for the World 
Bank Group to bring together relevant actors to 
address global, regional, and local development 
challenges. This is because trust funds and FIFs, 
as financial vehicles, are the essential components 
around which global partnership programs and 
other global initiatives are constructed and operate. 
The evaluation also found that the Bank Group both 
leads and supports convening in different instances. 
The leaders of partner organizations view the Bank 
Group‚Äôs comparative advantages in convening as 
its global reach, country presence, central place 
in international development networks, data and 
research, and its ability to work across sectors and to 
design and apply innovative financial instruments.3 
As the following examples illustrate, the World Bank 
Group has a unique ability to convene partners, 
draw upon its deep professional expertise and 
knowledge as a thought leader, provide trusted 
sources of development data and analysis, facilitate 
consensus on approaches to key development 
issues, and then activate these approaches in the 
Bank Group‚Äôs country operations. These abilities 
enable the Bank Group to use trust funds for the 
purpose of partnership. See more information about 
these activities and their contributing development 
partners in the accompanying 2021 Yearbook of 
Trust-funded Results. 
CONVENING MULTIPLE ACTORS
The World Bank Group is able to convene a broad 
range of actors around an agenda. For example, 
under the FoodSystems2030 Umbrella 2.0 Program, 
the World Bank is bringing together stakeholders‚Äî
from farmers to government policy makers‚Äîto 
repurpose agricultural policies to make food systems 
more resilient, sustainable, and fit-for-purpose from 
the point of view of people, the economy, and the 
planet. What started as a policy note to COP24 in 
2018 became a critical contribution to the UN Food 
System Summit in September 2021 and a key lever 
for mobilizing action under the cross-cutting theme 
on Nature at COP26 in 2021. 
ENGAGING AS A PROGRAM PARTNER
Once programs have been established, the World 
Bank Group actively engages as a partner, by 
facilitating agreements on approaches to key 
development issues, and then operationalizing these 
approaches in the Bank Group‚Äôs country operations. 
Since the formulation of its first strategy for working 
with the European Union (EU) in 2010, the World 
Bank has been a critical partner of the EU in Europe 
and Central Asia (ECA), by contributing its technical 
expertise, global experience, and ability to structure 
and deliver large-scale operations. The new 
Strategic European Partnerships Umbrella 2.0 
Program (STEP-UP) is the most recent iteration of 
this partnership, focusing on a) harnessing relevant 
knowledge and expertise, b) ensuring shared policy 
priorities for institutional strengthening, and c) 
leveraging areas of complementarity between EU 
and Bank priorities.
Since 2019, the World Bank has been convening 
partners around Gov-Tech, a whole-of-government 
approach to public sector modernization that 
promotes 
simple, 
efficient, 
and 
transparent 
government with the citizen at the center of 
reforms. The GovTech approach is at the forefront 
of supporting countries to digitally transform their 
governments to boost their effectiveness and 
improve service delivery using technologies already 
available and accessible in most countries. The 
GovTech Global Partnership has subsequently 
supported 
readiness 
assessments 
and 
new 
GovTech strategies for digital public service delivery 
in a range of countries.

Chapter 1. Optimizing External Funding and Partnerships
In 2017, the World Bank played an essential role as a 
facilitator, thought leader, and convener of a broad 
group of development partners, UN agencies, and 
the private sector to create a shared vision for ‚Äúgood‚Äù 
ID systems in the Principles of Identification for 
Sustainable Development. Since then, through the 
Identification for Development (ID4D) Program, 
the Bank has deeply infused these principles into its 
support for civil registration and ID systems globally, 
including analytical work, technical assistance, and 
over $1.5 billion in World Bank financing. Three years 
later, the same group of stakeholders came together 
to revisit the Principles to ensure that they continue 
to reflect new realities and good practices.
IFC‚Äôs 
Global 
Cities 
Platform 
connects 
municipalities, regional governments, and the 
private sector around complex cities transformation 
initiatives and underlying development challenges. 
The platform has enabled IFC to refocus its work 
with three of Colombia‚Äôs largest cities during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. It pivoted from catalyzing 
investments in sustainable urban infrastructure to 
helping the public sector balance the need to protect 
citizens and slow the spread of the virus with a 
desire to reopen economies. In 2020, IFC supported 
the city of Bogota to define and collect data on the 
impact of the quarantine on women, which will be 
used to inform a data-driven gender-sensitive policy 
response. IFC is also preparing Advisory packages 
covering smart cities, urban mobility, waste and 
water solutions, and environmental and social 
policies, tailored to the needs of each city.
ADVANCING CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
The World Bank Group works through trust-funded 
partnerships to advance cross-cutting issues 
inherent in the global consensus underlying the 
SDGs‚Äîin these cases, advancing gender equality.
Several years ago, the Public-Private Infrastructure 
Facility (PPIAF) and IFC began a modest initiative 
to advance gender equality in public-private 
partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure in the light of 
the World Bank‚Äôs 2015‚Äì23 Gender Strategy. This 
investigation of gender equity considerations within 
PPPs culminated in the publication of a primer on 
Gender Equality, Infrastructure and PPPs in May 
2019. Today, the primer is playing a key role in moving 
PPP practitioners in development banks and client 
countries toward a more systematic integration of 
gender considerations in PPP projects.
To share and build greater knowledge among 
governments, academia, industry, and civil society 
on actions that could enhance gender equality 
in oil, gas and mining, the Extractives Global 
Programmatic Support Program (EGPS) and 
the Inter-American Development Bank jointly 
organized the Second Gender Oil, Gas and Mining 
Conference, held virtually in March 2021. The World 
Bank contributed its deep professional expertise and 
knowledge to the conference to assist participants 
in bringing about improvements in all people‚Äôs lives 
working in the sector.
PROVIDING GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS
The World Bank is one of the main and most trusted 
sources of national sustainability data and analysis. It 
fosters collaboration and partnerships by providing 
global public goods in the form of analytical toolkits 
and open-source data portals.
Since 2016, the Global Procurement Partnership 
(GPP) has supported innovative activities for 
procurement reforms at the global and country 
levels, including the Methodology for Assessing 
Procurement Systems (MAPS). This universal 
diagnostic tool for public procurement systems 
assesses 
the 
accountability, 
integrity, 
and 
transparency of the public procurement systems 
of countries or jurisdictions, including the legal, 
regulatory, and institutional frameworks and market 
practices. The partnership has subsequently funded 
the implementation of 15 MAPS assessments across 
five regions, including eight IDA countries and five 
FCV-affected countries, and supported follow-up 
action plans and reforms in some of these countries.
In early 2019, the Financial Sector Reform and 
Strengthening Initiative (FIRST), the Global 
Program on Sustainability, and several other World 
Bank trust funds joined forces to improve the 
quality of publicly available environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) data. The Sovereign ESG 
Data Portal helps investors make more informed 
decisions and direct their capital to the countries, 
companies and projects where it is needed to meet 
the SDGs and the Paris Climate Accord targets. 
Launched in October 2019, the portal is a free, 
open, and easy-to-use online platform that provides 
users with sovereign-level ESG data, for all World 
Bank countries, so that investors can better engage 
sovereign issuers on ESG criteria and policies.
RALLYING IN-COUNTRY ACTORS 
The World Bank Group can also convene country-
level partners to enable trust funding. The World 
Bank set up and activated the Tunisia Economic 
Resilience and Inclusion (TERI) Umbrella 2.0 
Program in record time in March 2021 in response 
to an urgent request from the Tunisian government 
to help put in place an end-to-end management 
and information system before the first COVID-9 
vaccines arrived in the country. The Bank mobilized 
relevant funds in a very short time period through 
an initial contribution by the United Kingdom, which 
enabled the Bank to respond to this request in a 
challenging and dynamic context.

In 2017, the World Bank played an essential role as a
facilitator, thought leader, and convener of a broad
group of development partners, UN agencies, and
the private sector to create a shared vision for ‚Äúgood‚Äù
ID systems in the Principles of Identification for
Sustainable Development. Since then, through the
Identification for Development (ID4D) Program,
the Bank has deeply infused these principles into its

RESPONDING TO THE 
COVID-19 CRISIS

The World Bank Group has made available around 
$157 billion from April 2020 through June 2021, 
including from IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA, trust funds, 
and portfolio allocations. The response recognizes 
that COVID-19 is not only a health crisis, but also 
a wide-ranging socio-economic crisis that involves 
saving lives, protecting poor and vulnerable people, 
ensuring sustainable business growth and job 
creation, and strengthening policies, institutions, 
and investments (Box 2.1).
World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs are 
all contributing to the COVID-19 response 
in accordance with their particular niches. 
4 Donor Balance Account (DBAs) are administrative accounts that the Bank establishes on behalf of an individual donor agency to 
temporarily hold funds until such time as they are returned to the donor agency, transferred to another trust fund, or used for purposes 
as agreed with the donor agency. DBAs are established by donor agency, not by donor country.
Many development partners are making new 
contributions to trust funds and FIFs for these 
purposes, including channeling resources in their 
Donor Balance Accounts held by the Bank Group.4 
2.1 TRUST FUND AND FIF 
CONTRIBUTIONS
IBRD/IDA TRUST FUNDS
By the end of FY2021, IBRD/IDA trust funds had 
contributed, in whole or in part, $1.13 billion to 248 
World Bank operations that are helping countries 
respond directly to the COVID-19 crisis. About 93 
percent of commitments ($1.06 billion) has been in 
the form of trust-funded RE grants and 7 percent 
of commitments ($77 million) have been in the 
form of trust-funded BE grants. About 41 percent of 
commitments ($481 million) were disbursed by June 
30, 2021. This represents more than 10 percent of 
all trust fund disbursements during the 15 months 
between April 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021.

Pillars of the World Bank Group Response to the COVID-19 Crisis
BOX 2.1
1. Saving lives: Helping countries stop transmission, deliver health services, ensure vulnerable 
households access to medical care, and build resilience for future pandemics.
2. Protecting the poor and most vulnerable people: Supporting income and food supplies for 
the most vulnerable, as well as employment for poorer households, informal businesses, and 
microenterprises. 
3. Ensuring sustainable business growth and job creation: Providing policy and financial 
assistance to businesses and financial institutions to help companies (especially small and medium-
enterprises) preserve jobs, weather the crisis, and return to growth.
4. Strengthening policies, institutions, and investments: Helping countries prepare for a resilient 
recovery, with an emphasis on improving governance and institutions.

Number of IBRD/IDA Trust Fund Activities Supporting Different Types of  
COVID-19 World Bank Operations
FIGURE 2.1
Of the 248 operations, 135 are lending projects, 
105 are ASA, and 8 are research and knowledge 
activities. The 135 lending projects were supported 
by 137 trust funds for BE activities, 65 co-financing 
trust funds for RE activities, and 26 stand-alone trust 
funds for RE activities. The 105 ASA were supported 
by 124 trust funds for BE activities and the 8 research 
and knowledge products were supported by 9 trust-
funds for BE activities (Figure 2.1).
As shown in Figure 2.2, the number of new trust-
funded BE grant commitments for the COVID-19 
response accelerated from five commitments in the 
third quarter of FY2020 (January to March 2020) to 
43 commitments in the fourth quarter (April to June 
2020), and 82 commitments in the first quarter of 
FY2021 (July to September 2020). The number of 
new trust-funded RE grant commitments peaked 
one quarter later at 26 grants during the second 
quarter of FY2021 (October to December 2020). 
Trust fund commitment amounts for both BE and 
RE activities peaked during the first quarter of 
FY2021, with BE grants at $27.4 million and RE 
grants at $297 million (Figure 2.3).
Number of COVID-19 Related Trust Fund Activities by Time Periods
FIGURE 2.2
IBRD/IDA trust funds are especially critical for 
countries that do not have access to IBRD/IDA 
financing. These include countries in arrears 
(Zimbabwe and Sudan),5 and non-members (West 
Bank and Gaza). Syrian refugees in Lebanon and 
Jordan, and Venezuelan refugees in Ecuador are 
other special cases where trust funds can provide 
vital resources because their access to IBRD or IDA 
resources is constrained. The COVID-19 pandemic 
has also exacerbated risks in FCV-affected 
countries, such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Five of the 
top 10 countries receiving trust fund support for 
COVID-19-related activities are affected by FCV and 
collectively accounted for 54 percent of total trust 
fund commitments for COVID-19 response.
For example, the Afghanistan Reconstruction 
Trust Fund (ARTF) approved five RE grants totaling 
$470 million during FY2021, alongside IDA financing 
of $420 million, to help the country respond to the 
COVID-19 crisis. This included a development policy 
grant to strengthen the policy for relief and recovery 
and four investment projects that aimed to support 
critical food supply chains, provide emergency 
support to households, improve access to and 
quality of water supplies, and strengthen national 
systems for public health preparedness.

Chapter 2. Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis
The Jordan Inclusive Growth and Economic 
Opportunities MDTF provided $24.17 million 
alongside $350 million of IBRD financing for 
the Jordan Emergency Cash Transfer COVID-19 
Response Project, which was approved in June 
2020. Like other small, open economies with strong 
links to global markets, Jordan‚Äôs real GDP contracted 
by 1.6 percent in 2020 due to profound impacts on 
key sectors of the economy, such as services, travel 
receipts, and tourism. Economic contraction and 
job loss have hit women and youth especially hard. 
The project is providing temporary cash transfers to 
270,000 poor and vulnerable households adversely 
affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.
Low-income countries have received 62 percent 
of total COVID-19-related trust fund commitments 
and lower middle-income countries have received 
25 percent. The World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) initiated a Debt Service 
Suspension Initiative (DSSI) allowing participating 
countries to temporarily suspend debt-service 
payments to their official creditors. Since its launch 
on May 1, 2020, the initiative has delivered more 
than $5 billion in relief to more than 40 countries 
who chose to participate in it, out of the 73 eligible 
countries.6 About 64 percent of total COVID-19-
related trust fund commitments have gone to 
participating DSSI countries, and another 9 percent 
to non-participating eligible countries. 
The transition of the IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio 
toward better focused, more consolidated Umbrella 
2.0 Programs is also showing results through the 
World Bank Group‚Äôs crisis response. A total of 27 
Umbrella Programs have responded to COVID-19 
with new grant-level commitments, collectively 
representing 57 percent of the total trust fund 
response of $1.13 billion as of end of FY2021. 
The remainder of the response has come in part 
from three FIF-supported programs (28 percent) for 
which the World Bank is one of the implementing 
entities‚Äîthe Global Partnership for Education, the 
Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, and the 
Global Concessional Financing Facility‚Äîand from 
some other large trust-funded programs (14 percent) 
like the West Bank and Gaza MDTF. The top seven 
programs, led by the Afghanistan Reconstruction 
Trust Fund, have accounted for 84 percent of 
the grant commitments to COVID-19-related 
activities (Figure 2.4).

COVID-19 Related Trust-Funded Activities: Seven Largest Programs by  
Approved Grant Amounts
FIGURE 2.4
Overall, the umbrella framework has facilitated a 
more rapid response than might otherwise have 
been the case. Some programs have streamlined 
grant-making processes to make crisis recovery 
funds available to implementing partners as quickly 
as possible. They have also pivoted existing grants 
to address clients‚Äô most immediate needs. These 
adjustments have enabled programs to free up 
resources to support their COVID-19 responses and 
deliver on the most pressing priorities. 
For example, the Global Facility for Disaster 
Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) has adapted 
existing engagements to help countries manage 
the pandemic. It is supporting the development 
of emergency preparedness plans and response 
protocols, identifying and repurposing public 
facilities, and scaling approaches that link disaster 
risk management preparedness and response 
systems to health emergencies. Going forward, 
GFDRR will work with partners to support 
communities and countries to meet the dual 
challenge of managing natural hazard risks, while 
mobilizing the disaster risk management community 
to address the impacts of the pandemic.
The Human Rights, Inclusion and Empowerment 
(HRIE) 
program 
has 
also 
adjusted 
grant 
implementation to make up for cancelled or 
postponed on-the-ground activities, such as 
primary data collection, engagement with local 
governments and CSOs, and field visits to supervise 
implementation. 
Working 
with 
governments 
and CSOs, teams have shifted gears to continue 
reaching out to marginalized populations. An 
e-learning program was developed in lieu of in-
person training, enabling teams to reach much 
broader audiences than previously anticipated.
The Debt Management Facility (DMF) has 
also changed its way of doing business to meet 
client country needs. Instead of traveling to client 
countries to provide technical assistance, it has 
adapted to remote delivery. It has also prioritized the 
development of new Massive Online Open Courses 
(MOOCs) offering self-paced learning opportunities, 
as well as adapting other training and learning 
opportunities to a virtual format. 
From a thematic perspective, five World Bank 
Global Practices collectively account for 87 percent 
of the IBRD/IDA trust fund response to COVID-19, 
starting with the Health, Nutrition and Population 
Global Practice at 28 percent (Figure 2.5). These 
show that the Bank‚Äôs COVID-19 response addresses 
not just the health crisis, but also the wider socio-
economic crisis.

The Jordan Inclusive Growth and Economic
Opportunities MDTF provided $2417 million
alongside $350 million of IBRD financing for
the Jordan Emergency Cash Transfer COVID-19
Response Project, which was approved in June
2020. Like other small, open economies with strong
links to global markets, Jordan's real GDP contracted
by 1.6 percent in 2020 due to profound impacts on
key sectors of the economy, such as services, travel
receipts, and tourism. Economic contraction and
job loss have hit women and youth especially hard.
The project is providing temporary cash transfers to
270,000 poor and vulnerable households adversely
affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.

Low-income countries have received 62 percent
of total COVID-19-related trust fund commitments
and lower middle-income countries have received
25 percent. The World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) initiated a Debt Service
Suspension Initiative (DSSI) allowing participating
countries to temporarily suspend debt-service
payments to their official creditors. Since its launch
on May 1, 2020, the initiative has delivered more
than $5 billion in relief to more than 40 countries
who chose to participate in it, out of the 73 eligible

to non-participating eligible countries.

The transition of the IBRD/IDA trust fund portfolio
toward better focused, more consolidated Umbrella
2.0 Programs is also showing results through the
World Bank Group's crisis response. A total of 27
Umbrella Programs have responded to COVID-19
with new grant-level commitments, collectively
representing 57 percent of the total trust fund
response of $1.13 billion as of end of FY2021.

The remainder of the response has come in part
from three FIF-supported programs (28 percent) for
which the World Bank is one of the implementing
entities‚Äîthe Global Partnership for Education, the
Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, and the
Global Concessional Financing Facility‚Äîand from
some other large trust-funded programs (14 percent)
like the West Bank and Gaza MDTF. The top seven
programs, led by the Afghanistan Reconstruction
Trust Fund, have accounted for 84 percent of
the grant commitments to COVID-19-related
activities (Figure 2.4),

Overall, the umbrella framework has facilitated a
more rapid response than might otherwise have
been the case. Some programs have streamlined
grant-making processes to make crisis recovery
funds available to implementing partners as quickly
as possible. They have also pivoted existing grants
to address clients‚Äô most immediate needs. These
adjustments have enabled programs to free up
resources to support their COVID-19 responses and
deliver on the most pressing priorities.

For example, the Global Facility for Disaster
Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) has adapted
existing engagements to help countries manage
the pandemic. It is supporting the development
of emergency preparedness plans and response
protocols, identifying and repurposing public
facilities, and scaling approaches that link disaster
risk management preparedness and response
systems to health emergencies. Going forward,
GFDRR_ will work with partners to support
communities and countries to meet the dual
challenge of managing natural hazard risks, while
mobilizing the disaster risk management community
to address the impacts of the pandemic.

The Human Rights, Inclusion and Empowerment
(HRIE) program has also adjusted grant
implementation to make up for cancelled or
postponed on-the-ground activities, such as

primary data collection, engagement with local
governments and CSOs, and field visits to supervise
implementation. Working with governments
and CSOs, teams have shifted gears to continue
reaching out to marginalized populations. An
e-learning program was developed in lieu of in-

Global Practice at 28 percent (Figure 2.5). These
show that the Bank's COVID-19 response addresses
not just the health crisis, but also the wider socio-
economic crisis.

Chapter 2. Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis
IFC TRUST FUNDS
The private sector‚Äôs role in development has 
never been more important than it is now, as the 
world works to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. 
Governments around the world have reallocated 
resources to combat the spread of COVID-19, 
making limited public resources scarcer and 
highlighting the importance of catalyzing private 
sector investments. 
IFC is helping countries weather the devastating 
economic impacts of COVID-19 and build a more 
sustainable, inclusive, and resilient future with the 
support of the private sector. With insolvencies 
looming across the developing world, IFC is working 
to preserve the private sector, rebuild economies, 
and work upstream to create projects that will 
attract investment back into developing countries. 
IFC‚Äôs goal is also to help restructure and recapitalize 
viable financial institutions and companies on their 
path to recovery, as well as alleviate bottlenecks in 
critical supply sectors such as health care. 
For example, IFC has launched a $4 billion Global 
Health Platform aimed at boosting the production 
and supply of critical COVID-19 health care products 
in developing countries. The initiative, supported by 
development partners, is focusing on manufacturing 
products, such as personal protective equipment, 
ventilators and other medical equipment, COVID-19 
test kits, therapeutic drugs, and vaccines. 
Strong emphasis is being placed on supporting 
clients operating in low-income and FCV-affected 
countries. To attract foreign direct investment 
into these more challenging locations, IFC is also 
leveraging concessional financing from trust funds.
As IFC works to help countries build a resilient 
recovery, trust funds will be important contributors. 
IFC aims to accelerate the expansion of upstream 
activities with the goal of building back better and 
delivering interventions that meet the short-term 
needs but also maintain a line of sight on longer-
term 
development 
challenges. 
Development 
partner support through trust funds will be needed 
to develop projects quickly, build capacity, and 
support delivery, as well as to mitigate risks and 
encourage the private sector to invest.
IFC is also working with the World Bank to ensure 
that countries have policies and regulations in place 
to resolve distressed assets, and that companies‚Äô 
underlying operations are restructured to be viable 
to support growth and sustain employment. 
IFC has adapted its delivery modes in response to 
COVID-19. It has overcome travel restrictions by 
moving to virtual outreach and delivery platforms, 
including piloting innovative approaches such as 
virtual reality assessments. The focus on virtual 
and remote consultation has spurred clients to 
adopt digital solutions that will facilitate future 
engagement.
FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY FUNDS 
The global initiatives supported by FIFs have 
provided much needed leadership and support 
in providing immediate relief to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Four health-related FIFs have played 
leading roles in COVID-19 vaccine research and 
development, preparedness and response: the 
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations 
(CEPI), 
International 
Finance 
Facility 
for 
Immunisation (IFFIm), the Global Fund to Fight 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), and 
the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF). 
In addition, the Advanced Market Commitment 
(AMC) for Pneumococcal Vaccines has served as 
a model for establishing the COVID-19 Vaccines 
Global Access (COVAX) AMC, which is creating 
market-based incentives to support more equitable, 
world-wide access to COVID vaccines.
Established in 2018, CEPI was one of the first 
organizations to start investing in the development 
of COVID-19 vaccines. Prior to the COVID-19 
pandemic, CEPI had allocated over $140 million to 
develop vaccines against MERS, a virus related to 
SARS-CoV-2. During 2020, CEPI was able to pivot 
most of its MERS and platform technology partners 
to work on COVID-19 and rapidly built up a portfolio 
of 11 vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. By the end of year, 
two of these vaccines had demonstrated high 
efficacy in preventing severe COVID-19 disease 
and had received emergency use authorizations, 
enabling roll out of vaccine doses in early 2021. 
Not only has CEPI invested in one of the world‚Äôs 
largest portfolio of vaccines against COVID-19, 
it has also awarded forgivable loans to expand 
global manufacturing capacity and established 
a global network of laboratories to standardize 
vaccine assessment.
Established in 2006, IFFIm issues Vaccine Bonds 
in capital markets, backed by binding pledges from 
donor countries, which provide immediate funding 
for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to purchase and 
distribute vaccines. With the World Bank serving 
as Treasury Manager, IFFIm has played a critical 
role in frontloading donor pledges to support the 
international community‚Äôs response to COVID-19 
pandemic. During 2020, IFFIm provided $272 
million to Gavi for use by CEPI to develop COVID-19 
vaccines. Then in January 2021, IFFIm provided a 
first tranche of $400 million to Gavi for COVAX AMC 
to fund the purchase of vaccines for 92 of the world‚Äôs 
poorest countries, and an additional $380 million for 
COVAX AMC as of June 30, 2021. The Vaccine Bonds 
issued by IFFIm to support these disbursements 
have included the first-ever Norwegian Kroner-
denominated bonds in July 2020 and the second 
largest issuance of $750 million in April 2021.
Established in 2002, the Global Fund also 
responded quickly and decisively to the COVID-19 
crisis, by approving up to $1 billion in April 2020 
to help countries respond to the pandemic; adapt 
their HIV, TB and malaria programs; and reinforce 
their 
already 
overstretched 
health 
systems. 
Through its COVID-19 Response Mechanism, 
the Global Fund has become the primary grant 
support to low- and middle-income counties for 
obtaining COVID-19 tests, treatments, and personal 
protective equipment. The Global Fund is also a 
founding partner of the Access to COVID-19 Tools 
Accelerator (ACT-Accelerator) and co-leads two 
of the ACT-Accelerator‚Äôs four components: the 
Diagnostics Pillar and Health Systems Connector. 
This global collaboration of leading public health 
agencies is working with governments, civil society 
and industry to accelerate the development and 
equitable distribution of tests, treatments, and 
vaccines and to strengthen health systems.
Until it closed in April 2021, PEF was a fast- 
disbursing financing mechanism to provide surge 
funding to IDA-eligible countries in the case of major 
multi-country disease outbreaks like COVID-19. 
Its Cash Window, which has been supported by 
traditional donor contributions into a trust fund, 
had paid out $61.4 million to support the front-
line response to Ebola in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo in 2018 and 2019. On March 31, 2020, 
conditions for a payout from the PEF Insurance 
Window were met, releasing the maximum 
coverage of $195.84 million to support the COVID-19 
pandemic response in IDA countries. The PEF 
Steering Body allocated the whole amount to 64 of 
the world‚Äôs poorest countries with reported cases 
of COVID-19, with special attention given to areas 
with the most vulnerable populations, especially in 
FCV-affected countries. By September 30, 2020, 
the entire insurance payout had been transferred to 
support COVID-19 responses, with the World Bank 
serving as one of the main implementing entities for 
PEF grants.
Other FIF-supported programs in agriculture, 
education, the environment, and infrastructure 
have also addressed some of the immediate socio-
economic effects of the crisis. They have been fully 
engaged in addressing the question of how the 
world can end the pandemic and emerge stronger, 
more united, more equitable, and more prepared for 
future known threats. (Section 3.3.)

Chapter 2. Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis
2.2 STORIES FROM THE FIELD
Trust-funded programs are contributing to the World 
Bank Group‚Äôs COVID-19 response by supporting 
efforts to save lives, protect poor and vulnerable 
people, ensure sustainable business growth and job 
creation, and strengthen policies, institutions, and 
investments. Many of these activities are detailed in 
the 2021 Yearbook of Trust-funded Results. 
SAVING LIVES
The Global Financing Facility (GFF) and the 
Health Emergency Preparedness and Response 
Fund (HEPR) are leading the IBRD/IDA trust funds‚Äô 
contribution to mitigating COVID-19 transmission, 
delivering health services, ensuring that vulnerable 
households have access to medical care, and 
building resilience for future pandemics. The 
Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) was 
also an important contributor until its closure in 
April 2021 (Figure 2.4). 
The GFF has played a complementary role to 
the World Bank‚Äôs efforts to finance the purchase 
and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, tests, and 
treatments. Its COVID-19 Essential Health Services 
grants have enabled partner countries to prioritize 
and strengthen primary care and community-based 
services, capacities, and the health workforce that 
are critical for the equitable and effective delivery of 
both COVID-19 tools and essential health services. 
The GFF is helping to ensure that as countries 
recover and build their next generation health 
systems, they prioritize access to quality, affordable 
care for women, children, and adolescents.
The World Bank set up the HEPR Umbrella Program 
in 2020 to complement regular IBRD/IDA resources. 
It provides upstream and catalytic funding to 
help countries prepare for and rapidly respond to 
emerging health emergencies, even when they occur 
outside their borders. By the end of FY2021, HEPR 
had secured over $175 million in donor contributions, 
and allocated nearly $117 million to 24 countries and 
regional efforts, with 59 percent of grant allocations 
to address the COVID-19 pandemic and 41 percent 
to prepare better for future health emergencies. 
Many of these grants have been processed as co-
financing to new or existing World Bank projects 
that focus on health emergency preparedness and 
the client countries‚Äô COVID-19 responses.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted 
the critical need for electricity to save lives. The 
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program 
(ESMAP) has developed a strong collaboration with 
the World Bank‚Äôs Health Global Practice and its 
global partners to rapidly deliver a climate-informed 
COVID-19 response. It is focusing on electrification 
of health facilities with renewable energy and 
sustainable operational models and on deployment 
of reliable and climate-smart cold chains to deliver 
vaccines. In Haiti, for example, ESMAP is supporting 
efforts to install solar hybrid electricity systems 
for prioritized health care and water facilities. 
Approximately 1 million people are expected to gain 
improved access to health services and clean water 
as a result. 
PROTECTING THE POOR AND  
MOST VULNERABLE
Trust funds are also supporting World Bank Group‚Äôs 
efforts to protect incomes and food supplies for 
the most vulnerable, as well as employment for 
poorer households, informal businesses, and 
microenterprises impacted by the pandemic. 
Leading the trust fund contribution to mitigating 
both the immediate and long-term disruptions to 
education is the Global Partnership for Education 
(GPE), a FIF for which the World Bank is an 
implementing entity. This includes more than $175 
million in World Bank-supervised RE grants to help 
children in recipient countries to continue to access 
learning opportunities, with a focus on girls and 
poor children, who have been the hardest hit by 
school closures. 
The Rapid Social Response‚ÄìAdaptive and 
Dynamic Social Protection (RSR‚ÄìADSP) Umbrella 
Program issued its latest call for grant proposals 
in early FY2021 to address gender-specific and 
differentiated concerns as part of social protection 
Orlando Barr√≠a / World Bank
and safety net responses to the pandemic. This call 
focused on systems to help households cope with 
income and job loss, ensure continued access to 
social and human capital services, and address 
the disproportionate socio-economic impact of the 
virus on women and girls. 
PROBLUE has prioritized activities supporting 
fishing communities that have been adversely 
impacted by the pandemic, as well as new activities 
around water and sanitation issues in the fisheries 
value chain.
The Extractives Global Programmatic Support 
(EGPS) Umbrella Program has established a $5.2 
million emergency response facility to provide 
short-term assistance to a range of international, 
regional, 
and 
local 
organizations 
providing 
relief to artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) 
communities. The COVID-19 pandemic threatened 
to reverse the enormous progress that ASM 
communities have made to formalize the sector. 
Similar to informal workers worldwide, ASM 
communities are disproportionally vulnerable to the 
COVID-19 crisis due to poor health care, precarious 
working conditions, high incidence of respiratory 
diseases, and exposure of vulnerable groups in an 
environment of limited government oversight.
‚ÄúSome of the poorest and most 
vulnerable people work in artisanal and 
small-scale mining, and we are deeply 
concerned by the effects of COVID-19 
on their lives and livelihoods. EGPS is 
well-placed to provide significant and 
concerted support.‚Äù

and strengthen primary care and community-based
services, capacities, and the health workforce that
are critical for the equitable and effective delivery of
both COVID-19 tools and essential health services.
The GFF is helping to ensure that as countries
recover and build their next generation health
systems, they prioritize access to quality, affordable
care for women, children, and adolescents.

The World Bank set up the HEPR Umbrella Program
in 2020 to complement regular IBRD/IDA resources.
It provides upstream and catalytic funding to
help countries prepare for and rapidly respond to
emerging health emergencies, even when they occur
outside their borders. By the end of FY2021, HEPR
had secured over $175 million in donor contributions,
and allocated nearly $117 million to 24 countries and
regional efforts, with 59 percent of grant allocations
to address the COVID-19 pandemic and 41 percent
to prepare better for future health emergencies.

Many of these grants have been processed as co-
financing to new or existing World Bank projects
that focus on health emergency preparedness and
the client countries‚Äô COVID-19 responses.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted
the critical need for electricity to save lives. The
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program
(ESMAP) has developed a strong collaboration with
the World Bank's Health Global Practice and its
global partners to rapidly deliver a climate-informed
COVID-19 response. It is focusing on electrification
of health facilities with renewable energy and
sustainable operational models and on deployment
of reliable and climate-smart cold chains to deliver
vaccines. In Haiti, for example, ESMAP is supporting
efforts to install solar hybrid electricity systems
for prioritized health care and water facilities.
Approximately 1 million people are expected to gain
improved access to health services and clean water
as a result.

PROTECTING THE POOR AND
MOST VULNERABLE

Trust funds are also supporting World Bank Group's
efforts to protect incomes and food supplies for
the most vulnerable, as well as employment for
poorer households, informal businesses, and
microenterprises impacted by the pandemic.
Leading the trust fund contribution to mitigating
both the immediate and long-term disruptions to
education is the Global Partnership for Education
(GPE), a FIF for which the World Bank is an
implementing entity. This includes more than $175
million in World Bank-supervised RE grants to help
children in recipient countries to continue to access
learning opportunities, with a focus on girls and
poor children, who have been the hardest hit by
school closures.

The Rapid Social Response-Adaptive and
Dynamic Social Protection (RSR-ADSP) Umbrella
Program issued its latest call for grant proposals
in early FY2021 to address gender-specific and
differentiated concerns as part of social protection

and safety net responses to the pandemic. This call
focused on systems to help households cope with
income and job loss, ensure continued access to
social and human capital services, and address
the disproportionate socio-economic impact of the
virus on women and girls.

(EGPS) Umbrella Program has established a $5.2
million emergency response facility to provide
short-term assistance to a range of international,
regional, and local organizations providing
relief to artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM)
communities. The COVID-19 pandemic threatened
to reverse the enormous progress that ASM
communities have made to formalize the sector.
Similar to informal workers worldwide, ASM
communities are disproportionally vulnerable to the
COVID-19 crisis due to poor health care, precarious
working conditions, high incidence of respiratory

Chapter 2. Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis
SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE 
BUSINESS GROWTH AND JOBS
World Bank Group trust funds are providing policy 
and financial assistance to governments, businesses, 
and financial institutions to help companies, 
especially small and medium-enterprises (SMEs), 
preserve jobs, weather the crisis, and return 
to growth.
The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor 
(CGAP) has provided guidance to microfinance 
institutions on navigating the COVID-19 crisis and 
improving their resilience to future shocks, and to 
governments on improving government-to-person 
payment (G2P) systems. The World Bank and CGAP 
have helped accelerate policy reforms in countries 
that had not yet invested in digital systems and 
were struggling to distribute relief payments. CGAP 
support to Ecuador, Indonesia, Lebanon, Pakistan, 
the Philippines, Sudan, and Zambia, among others, 
has resulted in reforms being implemented in a few 
months that would normally take years.
COVID-19 was impacting women differently than 
men. In response, the SheWorks companies came 
together for a series of webinars to share lessons 
learned about how to support employees, especially 
women, during the pandemic. They reported that the 
family-friendly policy frameworks, like flex-work and 
remote working that had been put in place due to 
SheWorks, enabled them to seamlessly transition to 
work from home during lock downs. This COVID-19 
study has led to two new IFC projects in Sri Lanka

Environmental Health, Air Quality Management, 
and Circular Economy, will have strong links to the 
COVID-19 pandemic in terms of analytical work, 
addressing connections between air pollution and 
COVID-19 outcomes. 
PROBLUE is also contributing to a clean recovery 
through its focus on marine pollution prevention, 
for example, by assessing the impacts of single-
use plastics use in health care facilities and by 
developing health care waste management plans in 
cities along rivers and in coastal areas. 
STRENGTHENING POLICIES, 
INSTITUTIONS, AND INVESTMENTS
Trust-funded activities are also helping countries 
prepare for a resilient recovery, with an emphasis on 
improving governance and institutions. The Global 
Tax Program (GTP) Umbrella Program responded to 
the COVID-19 crisis by providing countries with just-
in-time fiscal policy advice on developing effective, 
efficient, and balanced fiscal policy responses. 
This has included macro-fiscal policy, domestic 
resource mobilization, expenditure policy, and fiscal 
risk management, plus important cross-cutting 
themes, such as poverty and distributional impact, 
transparency, and accountability. An additional 
$5.4 million in donor contributions is supporting 
GTP efforts on long-term fiscal sustainability 
and resilience. 
In 2020, IFC signed its first national-level agreement 
with the Federal Government of Somalia to

he World Bank Group‚Äôs COVID-19 crisis 
response has provided an opportunity 
to support a strong, durable recovery that 
tackles rising poverty and deepening 
inequality while addressing the longer-
term challenge of climate change. 
The Bank Group‚Äôs green, resilient, and inclusive 
development approach, or GRID, calls for  scaling up 
investments in all forms of capital‚Äîhuman, physical, 
natural, and social‚Äîto drive growth, create jobs, 
and contribute to a better future for all, especially 
vulnerable, low-income populations. Integrated, 
longer-horizon GRID strategies can repair the 
structural damage caused by COVID-19 and 
accelerate climate action while restoring momentum 
on poverty reduction and shared prosperity. 
The World Bank Group is well positioned to help 
countries with the challenges ahead through 
its convening power, global reach, and capacity 
to mobilize finance, technical assistance, and 
knowledge for both the public and private sectors 
and in cooperation with its development partners. 
This clear line of sight forward points to progress 
already being made to strengthen resilience across 
systems and society. 
Looking back over the last five years, trust funds 
and FIFs have supported World Bank Group 
public and private sector efforts in health, climate 
action, gender, social protection and jobs, and debt 
management‚Äîall essential building blocks for 
greater resilience and key development priorities 
of client countries. Not only do these themes align 
with the GRID approach, but they also reveal the

As shown in Table 3.1, social protection and jobs has 
received more than 42 percent of IBRD/IDA trust 
fund support to these five themes during the last five 
years, followed by health (28 percent) and climate 
action (24 percent). About 68 percent of FIF support 
has been for health and 31 percent for climate 
action. Together with IFC‚Äôs ongoing work with the

Chapter 3. Building Resilience Now and Into the Future
Ensuring that every man, woman, and child has 
access to health care is fundamental to ending 
poverty and building robust economies. The 
pandemic has disrupted delivery of essential health 
services, particularly in the poorest nations with the 
most fragile health systems, threatening to reverse 
years of hard-won gains in health and human capital 
outcomes. Now more than ever there is a need to 
strengthen national health systems‚Äô preparedness 
and capacities and ensure continuity of essential 
health services. 
In addition to health interventions related to 
COVID-19 (Section 2.2), ongoing health sector 
investments and research within the World Bank 
are focused on building resilient health systems, 
with trust funds playing an integral role. 
For example, the Global Financing Facility for 
Women, Children and Adolescents (GFF) is 
supporting the World Bank‚Äôs Liberia Health System 
Strengthening Project to improve service delivery 
and health outcomes for women and children. 
This work had contributed to 24 percent more 
assisted deliveries and 20 percent more children 
being immunized in six at-risk counties, but these 
gains were jeopardized when COVID-19 disrupted 
delivery of essential services. The GFF quickly 
adapted its grant funding to focus on strengthening 
community health channels and addressing low 
service demand. Funding helped modify the delivery 
of routine health services for COVID-19, increase the 
capacity of frontline health care workers, and adapt 
existing programming to address emergency needs.
The GFF has also worked alongside the World Bank 
and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund 
(ARTF) on the Sehatmandi Project to improve 
the delivery and quality of health, nutrition, and 
family planning services in 34 provinces across 
Afghanistan. By the end of FY2021, a first-ever 
resource mapping and expenditure tracking exercise 
had helped to assess the impact of investments on 
the quality of basic health services. 
A new performance-based system was also 
introduced to better manage service provider 
contracts and link payment to performance 
in delivering 11 key health services, including 
immunization, skilled birth attendance, family 
planning visits, and growth monitoring of children. 
The volume of services delivered under the project 
increased for 10 out of 11 payment indicators. For 
example, between 2018 and 2019, the number of 
couple-years of contraceptive protection provided 
by Sehatmandi facilities increased by 49 percent 
and the number of women giving birth at a health 
facility increased by 21 percent.

CAMBODIA: PRO-POOR 
APPROACH TO QUALITY  
HEALTH SERVICES
The Cambodia Health Equity and Quality 
Improvement Program (H-EQIP) MDTF supports 
a program of the same name that is helping the 
Cambodian government improve nationwide access 
to better quality, affordable health services. Despite 
dramatic reductions in poverty and improved health 
outcomes (especially in maternal and child health), 
socio-economic and rural-urban health inequalities 
persist in Cambodia. About one quarter of the 
population remains vulnerable to small economic 
shocks, and out-of-pocket expenditures on health 
care are around 60 percent‚Äîone of the highest 
rates in the world. 
To improve service quality and help poor households 
overcome the cost barrier, H-EQIP helped launch 
service delivery grants, which are regular payments 
to health facilities based on performance, and 
health equity funds (HEFs), which purchase health 
services on behalf of registered households so that 
they can access care free of charge. 
These platforms are now predominantly funded by 
the government, and strong national ownership 
is assured by the Payment Certification Agency 
(PCA), an independent public entity that verifies 
reimbursements to health facilities. The PCA 
provides a cost-efficient and sustainable mechanism 
for managing the HEF system and is well placed to a 
play a central role as Cambodia progresses toward 
universal health coverage.
Service delivery grants now flow to all health facilities 
on time, and the PCA is fully staffed and operational. 
HEFs operate at all public health facilities in the 
country, and H-EQIP performance monitoring tools 
were digitized in 2019 to ease tracking of service 
quality. These and other measures have helped to 
reduce the proportion of households vulnerable 
to high health care costs by 43 percent from 
2015 to 2020.
An important moment for H-EQIP came in 2020 
when 
its 
Contingent 
Emergency 
Response 
Component (CERC) was activated. This enabled 
immediate mobilization of $14 million for Cambodia‚Äôs 
COVID-19 response without interrupting continuity 
in the delivery of core health services.

health sector and beyond, thanks to its 
effective approaches to performance-
based and decentralized financial 
management, its use of information 
and communications technology, and 
governance reforms.‚Äù

pandemic has disrupted delivery of essential health
services, particularly in the poorest nations with the
most fragile health systems, threatening to reverse
years of hard-won gains in health and human capital
outcomes. Now more than ever there is a need to
strengthen national health systems‚Äô preparedness
and capacities and ensure continuity of essential
health services.

In addition to health interventions related to
COVID-19 (Section 2.2), ongoing health sector
investments and research within the World Bank
are focused on building resilient health systems,
with trust funds playing an integral role.

For example, the Global Financing Facility for
Women, Children and Adolescents (GFF) is
supporting the World Bank's Liberia Health System
Strengthening Project to improve service delivery
and health outcomes for women and children.
This work had contributed to 24 percent more
assisted deliveries and 20 percent more children
being immunized in six at-risk counties, but these
gains were jeopardized when COVID-19 disrupted
delivery of essential services. The GFF quickly
adapted its grant funding to focus on strengthening

36 e WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2021

community health channels and addressing low
service demand. Funding helped modify the delivery
of routine health services for COVID-19, increase the
capacity of frontline health care workers, and adapt
existing programming to address emergency needs.

The GFF has also worked alongside the World Bank
and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund
(ARTF) on the Sehatmandi Project to improve
the delivery and quality of health, nutrition, and
family planning services in 34 provinces across
Afghanistan. By the end of FY2021, a first-ever
resource mapping and expenditure tracking exercise
had helped to assess the impact of investments on
the quality of basic health services.

A new performance-based system was _ also
introduced to better manage service provider
contracts and link payment to performance
in delivering 11 key health services, including
immunization, skilled birth attendance, family
planning visits, and growth monitoring of children.
The volume of services delivered under the project
increased for 10 out of 11 payment indicators. For
example, between 2018 and 2019, the number of
couple-years of contraceptive protection provided
by Sehatmandi facilities increased by 49 percent
and the number of women giving birth at a health
facility increased by 21 percent.

CAMBODIA: PRO-POOR
APPROACH TO QUALITY
HEALTH SERVICES

The Cambodia Health Equity and Quality
Improvement Program (H-EQIP) MDTF supports
a program of the same name that is helping the
Cambodian government improve nationwide access
to better quality, affordable health services. Despite
dramatic reductions in poverty and improved health
outcomes (especially in maternal and child health),
socio-economic and rural-urban health inequalities
persist in Cambodia. About one quarter of the
population remains vulnerable to small economic
shocks, and out-of-pocket expenditures on health
care are around 60 percent‚Äîone of the highest
rates in the world.

To improve service quality and help poor households
overcome the cost barrier, H-EQIP helped launch
service delivery grants, which are regular payments
to health facilities based on performance, and
health equity funds (HEFs), which purchase health
services on behalf of registered households so that
they can access care free of charge.

These platforms are now predominantly funded by
the government, and strong national ownership
is assured by the Payment Certification Agency
(PCA), an independent public entity that verifies
reimbursements to health facilities. The PCA
provides a cost-efficient and sustainable mechanism
for managing the HEF system and is well placed to a
play a central role as Cambodia progresses toward
universal health coverage.

Service delivery grants now flow to all health facilities
on time, and the PCA is fully staffed and operational.
HEFs operate at all public health facilities in the
country, and H-EQIP performance monitoring tools
were digitized in 2019 to ease tracking of service
quality. These and other measures have helped to
reduce the proportion of households vulnerable
to high health care costs by 43 percent from
2015 to 2020.

An important moment for H-EQIP came in 2020
when its Contingent Emergency Response
Component (CERC) was activated. This enabled
immediate mobilization of $14 million for Cambodia's
COVID-19 response without interrupting continuity
in the delivery of core health services.

"H-EQIP is driving reform across the

health sector and beyond, thanks to its
effective approaches to performance-

based and decentralized financial
management, Its use of information

and communications technology, and

governance reforms.‚Äô

Chapter 3. Building Resilience Now and Into the Future
The threat of climate change remains critical for 
countries, forcing people to evacuate homes, grapple 
with food insecurity, or the impacts of deforestation 
and biodiversity loss, even as they also deal with 
the health and economic impacts of the pandemic. 
Left unchecked, climate change will push 132 million 
people into poverty over the next 10 years, undoing 
hard-won development gains. 
The World Bank Group is the largest multilateral 
provider of climate finance for developing countries, 
and it is focused on increasing climate ambition 
and action around the world. Ongoing trust-
funded activities are not only helping countries 
cope with climate vulnerabilities that threaten their 
ongoing development, but also helping them stay 
competitive as the global economy moves toward a 
net-zero future.
For example, the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection 
Program (SASSP) is supporting adaptive social 
protection programs in six Sahelian countries. The 
combination of cash transfers and assistance is 
helping poor and vulnerable households become 
more resilient to shocks and stresses, particularly 
the impacts of climate change. The program has 
helped pilot an early drought response mechanism 
that uses satellite data to trigger rapid-response 
cash transfers to at-risk households in Mauritania 
and Niger.
The Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance 
Facility (SEADRIF) is a first-of-its-kind facility in 
Asia that leverages financial markets to provide 
member countries with technical and financial 
solutions for better protection against disaster 
shocks in the face of climate risks. The first insurance 
product, a regional catastrophe risk pool launched in 
2021, is underpinned by the first regional near-real-
time flood monitoring platform and risk model. This 
enables governments to make better risk-informed 
decisions before, during, and in the aftermath 
of flooding.
The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility 
(PPIAF) is helping to expand African markets 
for pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) solar, a fast-growing 
business model for off-grid lighting and electricity 
solutions. Together with IFC, PPIAF created the 
PAYGO Market Attractiveness Index, which PAYGO 
operators are using to assess demand, supply, and 
enabling factors at a country-by-country level. 
Policymakers can also use it to identify gaps and 
opportunities for policy interventions and reforms. 
Trust funds are also financing research and 
knowledge tools to support greater climate 
resilience and low-carbon growth. The Climate 
Support Facility (CSF) helped Ethiopia assess 
its Climate Resilient Green Economy Strategy for 
mainstreaming into national development plans, 
as well as updating its Nationally Determined 
Contribution ahead of COP26 in November 2021. 
In the small island nation of Tuvalu, a study funded by 
the Quality Infrastructure Investment Partnership 
(QIIP) provided technical specifications and 
engineering solutions to fix the runway at the 
Funafuti International Airport, which had failed due 
to moisture build-up exacerbated by sea level rise, 
increased rainfall, and larger waves.

Since 
2015, 
the 
Forest 
Conservation 
and 
Sustainability in the Heart of the Colombian 
Amazon Project has played a critical role in reducing 
deforestation, conserving biodiversity, and fostering 
climate resilience in the Amazon. It represents long-
term commitment and cooperation among donors, 
the government, and community organizations, 
with co-financing from government resources, 
bilateral cooperation agencies, and three rounds of 
FIF funding from the Global Environment Facility 
(GEF) implemented by the World Bank, the most 
recent of which was approved in 2021. 
Investments 
are 
helping 
to 
strengthen 
the 
management of protected areas‚Äîincluding the 
Serran√≠a de Chiribiquete National Park, the world‚Äôs 
largest national tropical rainforest protected area 
at 4.3 million hectares‚Äîand assisting national 
and subnational public institutions to mainstream 
environmental criteria into different areas of 
agriculture, mining, infrastructure, and land-use 
planning. Colombia‚Äôs forest and carbon monitoring 
systems are also being supported. 
The project is also enhancing the capacity of 
Indigenous and rural communities to undertake 
sustainable landscape management practices. 
Participatory 
community 
land-use 
planning 
processes have led to increased ecosystem 
connectivity and strengthened climate resilience 
in target areas. To date, rural households have 
signed 558 conservation agreements to preserve 
standing forests, restore degraded areas, and 
develop agroforestry activities on over 48,000 
hectares, conserving more than 40 percent of their 
farmland. In parallel, the government and research 
institutions are helping rural communities increase 
incomes and food security through climate-
smart livelihood alternatives that also strengthen 
low-carbon development and restore productive 
natural resources. 
The local planning approach has proven so 
successful that the government has expanded it to 
reach 12,000 households in the Amazon region as 
outlined in the National Development Plan. Newly 
approved GEF financing will help scale up efforts to 
strengthen management and financial sustainability 
of additional protected areas, and it will build on 
the results of local community agreements to 
expand the area under sustainable community 
forestry practices.

Chapter 3. Building Resilience Now and Into the Future
The 
pandemic 
has 
exposed 
existing 
social 
and economic inequities even more glaringly. 
Lockdowns, 
school 
closures, 
and 
economic 
downturn have disproportionately impacted the 
education, employment, and domestic lives of 
women and girls. The World Bank Group recognizes 
that major challenges like pandemics affect people 
differentially, often to the detriment of women and 
girls due to discriminatory laws and policies, as 
well as ingrained gender and social norms. It also 
recognizes that no country, community, or economy 
can achieve its potential without the full and equal 
participation of all its people. 
The World Bank Group is working to narrow gender 
gaps and elevate women as agents of economic 
growth, stability, and sustainability. Trust funds are 
helping to accelerate progress on human capital, 
increase women‚Äôs access to good jobs and asset 
ownership, and amplify women‚Äôs voice and agency. 
For example, the State and Peace Building Fund 
(SPF) helped pilot the Integrated Platform for 
Gender-based Violence Prevention and Response 
in four districts of Nepal back in 2016 to raise 
awareness about gender-based violence and 
improve services for survivors. A 24-hour toll-free 
helpline was launched to link survivors with shelter, 
psychosocial support, legal aid, and child support 
services provided by CSOs. The National Women 
Commission has since taken ownership of the 
project and expanded services nationwide, with the 
helpline providing nearly 13,500 integrated services 
to over 21,000 clients. 
The Competitive Industries and Innovation 
Program (CIIP) financed studies on building greater 
resilience and inclusion in the fisheries sector in 
Mauritania‚Äôs Nouadhibou Free Zone, a major hub for 
fresh fish exports. The goal is to connect small-scale 
fishermen and informal processors and traders 
(generally women) to the value chain. Both the 
government and the private sector are focused on 
building women‚Äôs entrepreneurship and other skills 
in this artisanal processing sector. 
World Bank Group-implemented funding from the 
Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) 
and the Doing Business Pakistan Project supported 
a partnership between the Government of Pakistan 
and the World Bank Group‚Äôs Women, Business 
and the Law Advisory Program that informed an 
amendment to Pakistan‚Äôs Companies Act. Passed 
in 2020, the amendment lifts the requirement for 
women entrepreneurs to provide the name of their 
father or husband during the company incorporation 
process. Through the We-Fi program, IFC and the 
World Bank are also working to catalyze outreach 
and 
investments 
in 
early-stage, 
high-impact 
technology start-ups led by women in Pakistan.
The InfoDev MDTF helped the World Bank and the 
Kenyan government assess business incubators 
and accelerators within the country to identify 
ways of better supporting women in technology 
and to inform the design of the Kenya Industry and 
Entrepreneurship Project. Consultations garnered 
feedback from potential women beneficiaries, 
including entrepreneurs, students, and small 
business owners. This research continues to 
contribute to a better understanding of women 
in Kenya‚Äôs business landscape, and offers a 
foundation for future gender-focused interventions 
in the country.

EAST AFRICA: MAKING MOBILE 
MONEY MORE ACCESSIBLE TO 
WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE 
Agriculture is the largest source of employment 
for women in developing countries, with women 
representing more than 60 percent of the agricultural 
labor force in some parts of Asia and Africa. Yet, 
women farmers have significantly less access to 
productive assets, including financial services. 
Digital financial services, accessed largely through 
mobile devices, have expanded the availability 
of financial products to smallholder farmers and 
represent a safe and convenient way to save, obtain 
loans, and make or receive payments. However, 
in low- and middle-income countries, women are 
36 percent less likely than men to own mobile 
money accounts. 
The Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality 
(UFGE) is supporting efforts to promote greater 
financial inclusion. It funded an assessment, 
Mobile Technologies and Digitized Data to Promote 
Access to Finance for Women in Agriculture, and 
follow-on technical assistance to help three digital 
financial service providers better understand 
the needs of women farmers and develop more 
targeted financial products and marketing. Lessons 
learned and recommendations from the three pilot 
programs were consolidated and captured in a 
2021 report, Women in Agriculture: Using Digital 
Financial Services. 
Fenix (now Engie Energy Access), an off-grid solar 
home system provider in Uganda, invested in new 
tools to better gather feedback from its women 
clients. It has since adapted the tools for other 
markets and is using them in countries like Benin. 
Safaricom‚Äôs Digifarm, a digital platform that offers 
financial and non-financial services to smallholder 
farmers in Kenya, partnered with a commercial 
bank to offer savings products better tailored to the 
financial needs of women involved in agriculture. It 
also engaged with women‚Äôs groups to build trust 
and understanding of financial products. Women 
now account for 48 percent of clients for multiple 
Digifarm products, a 10 to 15 percent increase since 
technical assistance began. 
MyAgro, a social enterprise that offers bundled 
services to farmers in Tanzania, also adopted new 
marketing mechanisms. It engaged influential 
women in leadership to encourage others to enroll 
in programs, and created marketing products with 
images and terminology familiar to local women 
involved in agriculture. MyAgro also made services 
more accessible by reducing the minimum package 
size and associated prices.

Chapter 3. Building Resilience Now and Into the Future
The Sudan Transition and Recovery Support 
(STARS) program, an umbrella coordination platform 
for World Bank engagement in Sudan, is supporting 
the economic and peacebuilding transition after the 
collapse of the former regime in November 2019. 
As part of a larger sustainable livelihoods project, 
STARS provided technical support and financing to 
promote youth entrepreneurship. Over 1,000 young 
people, 70 percent of whom were women, received 
technical and vocational skills training, while another 
1,400 women received home cultivation training. 
The project also established a permanent incubator, 
the Inventors Development Center, to nurture and 
train young Sudanese entrepreneurs and creators 
in areas like medicine, engineering, electronics, and 
information technology.
When the Eurozone crisis struck in late 2019, Greece 
lacked a well-targeted welfare system to support 
the most vulnerable. Through the Europe2020 
Programmatic Trust Fund financed by the 
European Commission, the World Bank brought 
critical global knowledge to the task of implementing 
new social safety net programs and provided 
hands-on support for a new social solidarity income 
program. By June 2019, the program had reached 
approximately 650,000 people (6.5 percent of the 
population). This work in Greece has led to similar 
reimbursable advisory services in Italy and has 
generated approaches applied in Russia, Argentina, 
Turkey, and a globally available and applied toolkit 
for practitioners.
SOCIAL PROTECTION & JOBS
Social protection programs are at the heart of 
boosting human capital for the world‚Äôs most 
vulnerable. Not only can they cushion the impact 
of crises like COVID-19, but at any time, they 
can empower people to be healthy, pursue their 
education, and seek opportunity to lift themselves 
and their families out of poverty. Social protection 
systems that are well-designed and implemented 
can enhance human capital and productivity, 
reduce inequalities, build resilience, and end inter-
generational cycles of poverty. 
Funding from trust funds is helping the World Bank to 
expand successful programs, pilot new approaches, 
and build the evidence base on what works and 
what does not in policies and programs for social 
safety nets and sustainable social insurance.
For example, the Identification for Development 
Initiative (ID4D) brought together a multi-sectoral 
team from across the World Bank to support the 
Government of the Philippines in developing its 
new national Philippine Identification System 
(PhilSys). Proof of identity is the key to accessing 
social and financial services, and those who lacked 
proper documentation can be locked out. PhilSys 
aims to register more than 90 million Filipinos and 
accelerate the country‚Äôs transition to an inclusive and 
resilient digital economy, society, and government. 
Integrating best practices for inclusion, data privacy,

ZAMBIA: PUTTING CASH IN  
THE HANDS OF THE POOR 
CHANGES LIVES
The objective of the Girls‚Äô Education and Women‚Äôs 
Empowerment and Livelihood (GEWEL) MDTF is 
to support the Government of Zambia in improving 
the effectiveness of its social protection system. 
Working through the GEWEL project, the trust fund 
helps increase women‚Äôs access to livelihood support 
and make secondary education more accessible to 
disadvantaged adolescent girls in extremely poor 
households in selected districts. It also supports 
cash transfers for poor and vulnerable households 
through the Social Cash Transfer (SCT) Program.
Bi-monthly SCT payments are helping families pay 
for school fees, cover medical and food expenses, 
and invest in small-scale businesses to boost 
incomes. To expand the program, the Zambian 
government secured funding from the World Bank 
and other partners through the GEWEL MDTF. 
In November 2020, payments began to flow to 
over 370,000 beneficiaries in 67 districts across the 
country prioritized based on poverty rates and size 
of SCT caseloads, among other factors. Additional 
World Bank financing will expand coverage to a 
total of 750,000 households in 2021 and 994,000 
households by 2022. This support will enable timely 
and predictable disbursements of cash transfers 
to 30 percent of the Zambian population and 50 
percent of the poor by 2022. 
A 2019 impact evaluation showed that the SCT 
program is contributing to increased human 
capital and productivity, both key to enhancing 
greater resilience. Households were found to have 
increased the land they operate by 18 percent, 
maize production by 8 percent, and livestock by 21 
percent. Households also increased their ability to 
meet the material needs of children (clothes, shoes, 
blankets) by 30 percent and increased the number 
of children attending primary school by 10 percent.

Social protection programs are at the heart of
boosting human capital for the world‚Äôs most
vulnerable. Not only can they cushion the impact
of crises like COVID-19, but at any time, they
can empower people to be healthy, pursue their
education, and seek opportunity to lift themselves
and their families out of poverty. Social protection
systems that are well-designed and implemented
can enhance human capital and productivity,
reduce inequalities, build resilience, and end inter-
generational cycles of poverty.

Funding from trust funds is helping the World Bank to
expand successful programs, pilot new approaches,
and build the evidence base on what works and
what does not in policies and programs for social
safety nets and sustainable social insurance.

For example, the Identification for Development
Initiative (ID4D) brought together a multi-sectoral
team from across the World Bank to support the
Government of the Philippines in developing its
new national Philippine Identification System
(PhilSys). Proof of identity is the key to accessing
social and financial services, and those who lacked
proper documentation can be locked out. PhilSys
aims to register more than 90 million Filipinos and
accelerate the country‚Äôs transition to an inclusive and
resilient digital economy, society, and government.
Integrating best practices for inclusion, data privacy,
and digital security, ID4D also helped adapt the
registration approach for COVID-19 to prioritize
low-income households that would benefit most
from a digital ID to access social protection and
financial services.

The Sudan Transition and Recovery Support
(STARS) program, an umbrella coordination platform
for World Bank engagement in Sudan, is supporting
the economic and peacebuilding transition after the
collapse of the former regime in November 2019.
As part of a larger sustainable livelihoods project,
STARS provided technical support and financing to
promote youth entrepreneurship. Over 1,000 young
people, 70 percent of whom were women, received
technical and vocational skills training, while another
1400 women received home cultivation training.
The project also established a permanent incubator,
the Inventors Development Center, to nurture and
train young Sudanese entrepreneurs and creators
in areas like medicine, engineering, electronics, and
information technology.

When the Eurozone crisis struck in late 2019, Greece
lacked a well-targeted welfare system to support
the most vulnerable. Through the Europe2020
Programmatic Trust Fund financed by the
European Commission, the World Bank brought
critical global knowledge to the task of implementing
new social safety net programs and provided
hands-on support for a new social solidarity income
program. By June 2019, the program had reached
approximately 650,000 people (6.5 percent of the
population). This work in Greece has led to similar
reimbursable advisory services in Italy and has
generated approaches applied in Russia, Argentina,
Turkey, and a globally available and applied toolkit
for practitioners.

Chapter 3. Building Resilience Now and Into the Future
Debt financing is critical for development, but 
unsustainable levels harm growth and the poor. 
Debt can be a useful tool if it is transparent, well-
managed, and used in the context of a credible 
growth policy, but this is often not the case. High 
public debt can inhibit private investment, increase 
fiscal pressure, reduce social spending, and limit 
governments‚Äô ability to implement reforms. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated debt 
stress in many emerging and developing economies, 
with increased spending on health, incomes, and 
employment. It has forced some countries to borrow 
more and compromised others‚Äô ability to repay 
creditors. For a resilient recovery, debt management 
and transparency need to be top priorities, along 
with domestic resource mobilization. The World 
Bank is helping countries around the world to 
strengthen their capacity to manage debt and tax 
revenue generation, with trust funds providing 
important resources for technical assistance 
and guidance.
For example, the Debt Management Facility (DMF) 
helps countries strengthen debt management to 
reduce debt-related vulnerabilities and improve debt 
transparency. It offers advisory services, training, and 
peer-to-peer learning to more than 80 developing 
countries around the world to strengthen their debt 
management capacity, processes, and institutions. 
DMF efforts have led to more countries preparing and 
publishing debt management strategies, improving 
the quality of government debt records, and better 
organizing their debt management institutions and 
coordination with fiscal policies through alignment 
with medium-term fiscal frameworks.
The Global Tax Program (GTP) enhances the 
World Bank‚Äôs capacity to support tax reforms, 
especially at this crucial time. The program provides 
an umbrella framework for tax support and leads an 
ongoing program of activities at both international 
tax and country levels focused on strengthening tax 
institutions and mobilizing revenues. 
For example, the GTP is funding the Kyrgyz 
Republic Tax Reform Technical Assistance Project, 
which is helping the Kyrgyz government to improve 
administrative 
effectiveness 
and 
reduce 
the 
compliance burden for taxpayers. Ongoing since 
2018, the project has provided advice on designing 
tax 
policy 
and 
administration, 
strengthening 
taxpayer communication and outreach, rebuilding 
business processes, and digitizing the issuance 
of tax certificates. The knowledge generated by 
this technical assistance is informing the Tax 
Administration and Statistical System Modernization 
Project for the Kyrgyz Republic approved by the 
World Bank in February 2020.
DEBT MANAGEMENT
GEORGIA: BUILDING A 
FRAMEWORK FOR GREATER 
FISCAL RESILIENCE
The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a steep 
increase in public debt across the world, including 
in Georgia. The government had to borrow 
substantially to finance stringent health measures, 
fiscal stimulus packages, and the deficit due to 
falling tax revenues. Hence, Georgia increased 
domestic debt issuance and, with additional support 
from development partners, the country was able 
to meet its government‚Äôs financing needs at a time 
when capital markets were in turmoil. Fortunately, 
Georgia had already built a framework for greater 
resilience, with support from the DMF, prior to 
the pandemic.
The DMF started providing technical assistance to 
Georgia in 2013 with an initial Debt Management 
Performance Assessment followed by a reform plan 
and several support missions for domestic debt 
market development. The assessment identified 
several areas of weaknesses in government debt 
management processes and procedures, as well as 
in the structure of debt and guarantees management. 
Through the assessment, reform plans, and training 
opportunities, the DMF catalyzed significant 
progress in Georgia‚Äôs debt management and 
assisted the country in reducing vulnerability 
to financial shocks. DMF training opportunities 
also improved the analytical capacity of debt 
management experts in the Ministry of Finance to 
conduct debt sustainability and portfolio analysis 
and formulate debt management strategies.
Since the initial DMF engagement in 2013, Georgia 
has improved debt management transparency 
with the publication of a semi-annual public 
debt statistical bulletin, monthly debt statistics, 
and annual debt sustainability analysis. The 
government has also developed and published debt 
management strategies, which provide guidance 
for borrowing operations and lay out measures for 
domestic market development. Cash management 
has also improved with the establishment of a cash 
management unit in the Ministry of Finance and the 
introduction of weekly and daily cash flow forecasts 
and active investment of surplus cash.

3.2 IFC TRUST FUNDS
IFC is also focused on building resilience. The GRID 
approach is apparent in its work with the private 
sector, whose role in development has never been 
more important than in the wake of COVID-19. 
IFC is deploying a comprehensive approach, utilizing 
the Creating Markets Upstream approach, Advisory 
services, and blended finance trust funds, to 
address protracted development challenges around 
the globe and build a pipeline of investment projects 
that will accelerate recovery after the pandemic. 
This constellation of IFC services will help pave the 
way for private sector investment in everything from 
climate change to digital infrastructure. Together 
with the contributions of development partners, 
IFC is de-risking emerging technologies, opening 
frontier markets, and delivering greater impact on 
the ground.
This work is informed by Country Private Sector 
Diagnostics many of which are co-funded with 
development partners,7 and driven by IFC Country 
Strategies. The diagnostics bring together the 
combined expertise of the World Bank and IFC to 
better align country-level engagement in regard 
to private sector development, including with 
development partners. 
An important component is IFC Advisory services, 
which are long-term engagements that build 
capacity and enable markets. As governments 
and companies have had to navigate multiple, 
compounding shocks during the past year, 
IFC‚Äôs work is helping to build the foundation for 
greater resilience. 
Advisory projects on digital financial services, for 
example, have helped governments revise their 
legislation to enable financial institutions to launch 
online banking services. As COVID-19 forced the 
closure of many brick-and-mortar bank branches, 
digital financial services have filled the void, making 
it possible for SMEs to continue to access financial 
services. Work with municipalities and infrastructure 
projects have helped to attract private capital for 
public projects, freeing up government resources 
for other needs, while general capacity building 
for SMEs has enabled them to access increased 
financing to meet short-term liquidity needs.
In West Africa, the travel and tourism industry lost 
nearly 30 percent of tourism-related jobs in 2020 
due to the pandemic, which exposed an over-
dependence on foreign travelers. IFC had been 
working to strengthen local tourism value chains 
through the Invest West Africa Tourism project 
funded by two global funds, IFC Support for G-20 
Compact with Africa Initiative (ISCA) and the 
Trust Fund to Facilitate USAID Access to IFC 
Advisory Service‚Äôs Expertise and Services. In 
light of COVID-19, IFC shifted its focus to supporting 
companies to access additional sources of financing 
and identify domestic markets. IFC provided 
coaching to 18 supplier companies and worked with 
C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire‚Äôs private-sector support committee 
to develop an online platform that helps affected 
companies identify and apply for loans, grants, and 
other financing support.
Trust funds are also supporting countries to build 
greener, more resilient energy sectors. IFC has 
been advising the government of Uzbekistan to 
transition from natural gas to solar energy through 
the country‚Äôs first competitively tendered PPP, the 
Uzbekistan Solar Project. A group of six trust funds8 
is supporting this effort. The success of this tender, 
which will bring the lowest tariff for solar energy in 
Central Asia, has spurred the government to launch 
two additional solar projects expected to add an 
additional 900 MW of solar generation capacity in 
the country. Going forward, this will help boost the 
resilience of Uzbekistan‚Äôs energy supply through 
renewable energy.

AFRICA: BUILDING THE 
CAPACITY OF SMES  
TO NAVIGATE COVID 19
When IFC conducted its 2018 Advisory Services 
Client Survey, clients identified skills training as 
the most anticipated need for the coming years. 
COVID-19 only heightened this need. Many 
micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), 
especially those with weak financial and business 
management skills, are finding it difficult to navigate 
and exit the COVID-19 crisis on a strong footing. 
MSMEs in the Middle East and North Africa 
(MENA) region, in particular, have been slower to 
digitize their operations and move to online sales 
and e-commerce than in other regions. COVID-19 
lockdown measures forced many MSMEs to 
suspend activities entirely.

In 2020, IFC launched the Grow Learn Connect 
project with support from several trust funds, 
including the MENA MSME 2.0 Trust Fund 
and the Partnership for Resilient Efficient and 
Sustainable SMEs Facility. Recognizing that 
financial institutions play an important role in 
enabling their MSME clients to mitigate business 
financial risks and maintain access to finance, the 
Grow Learn Connect team developed an interactive 
webinar series for MSMEs, focused on increasing 
business resilience and delivered through financial 
institutions. It covered topics such as how to access 
financing during crises, doing business online, and 
communicating with stakeholders during crises. In 
partnership with seven financial institutions, IFC 
delivered the webinar series to more than 1,100 
participants in six countries.
IFC will also work directly with financial institutions 
to create awareness about the benefits of offering 
nonfinancial services to MSMEs, such as business 
development services and access to information 
and markets, to complement and increase uptake of 
their financial services. Although the program was 
born out of a need to respond to COVID-19, IFC‚Äôs 
work in building skills and knowledge for financial 
institutions and MSMEs in MENA will benefit 
both types of institutions and result in companies 
that are better equipped to navigate the post-
COVID-19 world.
‚ÄúParticipants benefitted from support 
and advice on how to cope with the

plans, to access finance, to do business 
and market their goods and services

INTERMEDIARY FUNDS
FIFs are important financial vehicles that channel 
large-scale grant and concessional financing for 
critical global issues. Like trust funds, many FIFs 
support activities relate to the GRID approach and 
help to scale up collective action in health, climate, 
gender, jobs, and debt sustainability.
More than half (56 percent) of FIF resources were 
transferred to health programs during FY2017‚Äì21, 
and one quarter (25 percent) to environment 
and climate-related programs. This includes five 
health-related FIFs that support equitable access 
to COVID-19 vaccines, pandemic preparedness, 
and other aspects of the COVID-19 response 
(Section 2.1) and 12 FIFs that contribute to a range 
of environmental and climate-related activities. 
Other FIFs contribute to education, gender equality, 
infrastructure, and debt relief. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed 
the context in which the work of climate-related FIFs 
is taking place. Urgent and sizeable development 
assistance is needed to support governments, 
businesses, and communities to recover quickly 
from the economic downturn and rebuild for a 
greener, sustainable, and more resilient future. 
Pursuing low-emission and climate-resilient growth 
is the best way to unlock lasting socio-economic 
and environmental benefits. Coupling large-scale 
financial investments with technical assistance in the 
context of COVID-19 lending is advancing climate-
friendly policy reforms. Investments in clean energy 
are creating millions of jobs, while strengthening key 
economic sectors, to bolster COVID-19 recoveries. 
For example, the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) 
provide concessional financing for innovation and 
de-risking alongside multilateral development bank 
(MDB) investments in developing countries. The 
World Bank has been CIF‚Äôs largest implementing 
partner, disbursing roughly 50 percent of the funds. 
In April 2020 CIF introduced four new programs 
in the areas of renewable energy integration, 
climate-smart 
urbanization, 
low-carbon 
and 
climate-resilient industries, and nature, people, and 
climate investments. In March 2021, it launched 
the Accelerating Coal Transition (ACT) program, 
which offers a holistic approach to tackling the 
governance, people, and infrastructure challenges 
related to transitioning away from coal. In June 2021, 
four donors (Canada, Germany, USA, and the United 
Kingdom) announced new financial commitments 
of up to $2 billion to support ACT and renewable 
energy integration in developing countries.
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has 
implemented a variety of measures to assist 
countries in addressing the evolving challenges 
arising from the pandemic and to support efforts in 
building back better, greener, and more resilient. Its 
work embraces all facets of a healthy environment, 
including 
climate 
change, 
biodiversity 
loss, 
chemical pollution, and pressure on forests, oceans, 
landscapes, and wildlife. 
The GEF has a central role in restoring a better 
balance between people and nature and in 
addressing the underlying factors of zoonotic 
diseases, such as the global wildlife trade. GEF‚Äôs 
integrated programs‚Äîthe Good Growth Platform, 
the Sustainable Cities Impact Program, the Food, 
Land Use, and Restoration Impact Program, and the 
Wildlife Conservation for Development Program‚Äî
are helping countries to build economies and 
societies that will thrive despite inevitable future 
shocks. The proposed GEF-8 strategy for 2022‚Äì26 
will continue to build on this systemic approach 
by applying a Healthy Planet, Healthy People 
framework to develop a healthy, productive and 
resilient planet that underpins the well-being of 
human societies.
The Global Partnership for Education (GPE) 
has implemented one of the largest external aid 
programs dedicated to education in the global 
pandemic response. By June 2020, GPE had secured 
$500 million to establish a new accelerated funding 
window for COVID-19 response and recovery 
measures through which grants of $467 million have 
helped 66 partner countries mitigate the impact of 
the pandemic on children‚Äôs learning and build more 
resilient education systems. The World Bank has 
been a major implementing entity for these funds 
(Section 2.2). 
As a result of streamlined application and approval 
processes, 
the 
accelerated 
funding 
window 
has facilitated the swift delivery of support to 
countries most in need, with all funds disbursed to 
implementing entities by June 2021. The window 
required GPE funds to be based on the recipients‚Äô 
own response plan, to be complementary to other 
sources of COVID-19 support, and to be focused 
on reaching vulnerable populations (including 
girls, children with disabilities, poor, or displaced 
children) who are most susceptible to fall further 
behind during the pandemic.
The AgResults Initiative uses Pay-for-Results (PfR) 
prize competitions to incentivize the private sector 
to develop and deliver productivity-enhancing 
technologies to smallholder farmers. Its Challenge 
Projects demonstrate how to encourage local 
actors to develop linkages along selected value 
chains to address formerly missing markets with 
contextualized and more resilient solutions. The 
Vietnam GHG Emissions Reduction Challenge 
Project 
(2017‚Äì21) 
incentivized 
improved 
rice 
cultivation practices both to increase productivity 
and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 
Tanzania Dairy Challenge Project (launched in 
November 2019) is incentivizing private sector 
suppliers to deliver productivity-enhancing input 
bundles (parasite control, nutrition, vaccines, 
artificial insemination) to both men and women 
smallholder dairy farmers in a socially inclusive way.
Sustainable infrastructure is key to delivering 
economic growth, social progress, and climate 
action in line with the SDGs and Paris Agreement 
commitments. 
Created 
in 
2014, 
the 
Global 
Infrastructure Facility (GIF) is tackling head-on 
the dearth of bankable, sustainable infrastructure 
pipelines in developing countries through the 
provision of end-to-end transaction advisory 
services to national and subnational governments 
through ten MDB Technical Partners. 
The GIF supports developing country governments 
not only to prioritize, design, and structure 
individual low-carbon, climate-smart infrastructure 
transactions, but also to encourage programmatic 
approaches, including standardization efforts, that 
can lead to replication and aggregation. The goal 
is to appeal to institutional capital through better 
coordination with governments and development 
finance institutions. The GIF is heavily promoting 
climate mitigation, adaption and resilience: to date, 
74 percent of its current portfolio and 85 percent of 
its pipeline activities are climate-smart.

T
he World Bank Group‚Äôs trust funds 
and FIFs are strong proof of what 
can be accomplished when development 
partners work together to move toward 
greater resilience. Analysis of key financial 
trends across Bank Group trust funds 
and FIFs further underscores the forward 
momentum of this shared commitment.
This 
chapter 
provides 
aggregate 
financial 
information on the activities of trust funds and FIFs 
administered individually or jointly by the World 
Bank, IFC, MIGA, and ICSID, as well as externally 
financed outputs (EFOs). It looks at five-year 
trends, from FY2017 to FY2021, on trust fund and FIF 
inflows, outflows, and assets under management‚Äî
all of which demonstrate the World Bank Group‚Äôs 
position as the partner of choice to advance 
development agendas in countries, regions, and 
around the globe. Box 4.1 defines financial terms and 
Table 4.1 provides an overview of key financial data.
INFLOWS
Inflows, or contributions to World Bank Group trust 
funds and FIF, have remained strong and have shown 
an increase over the last five years, reaching $14.31 
billion in FY2021. In particular, cash contributions to 
IBRD/IDA trust funds rose to $4.08 billion in FY2021, 
an increase of 11 percent ($414 million) from FY2020 
primarily driven by cash contributions to the Sudan 
Transition and Recovery Support Program (STARS), 
the Global Financing Facility (GFF), and the Sint 
Maarten Recovery and Resilience Program. 
IFC trust fund contributions increased by 18 percent 
($48 million) in FY2021 compared to FY2020. Paid-in 
contributions (cash and promissory notes receipts) 
to FIFs increased from $8.94 billion in FY2020 to $9.91 
billion in FY2021. This increase was primarily due to 
increased contributions to the Green Climate Fund 
(GCF), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness 
Innovations (CEPI), and the Global Environment 
Facility (GEF). Almost 80 percent of this increase is 
to CEPI for the COVID-19 response. 
Development partners recognize the strategic 
advantages of entrusting their resources with 
the World Bank Group. It has the technical 
expertise, country experience, and supervision and 
reporting capacity to ensure funds are directed to 
development activities that align with agreed 
priorities and achieve impact at scale. Efficiency, 
relevance, global reach, and influential convening 
power are all reasons why development partners 
choose to contribute to trust funds and FIFs 
managed by the World Bank Group.
OUTFLOWS
Outflows, or disbursements from World Bank Group 
trust funds and cash transfers from FIFs, have 
increased in the last five years to reach $12.97 billion 
in FY2021. IBRD/IDA trust fund disbursements 
were $3.57 billion in FY2021, an increase of 2 
percent ($75 million) from FY2020. RE activities 
accounted for around 71 percent ($2.55 billion) of 
total disbursements and BE activities 29 percent 
($1.03 billion). The higher disbursements were 
driven mainly by STARS, the Global Partnership for 
Education (IBRD as implementing entity), and the 
Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (IBRD as 
implementing entity). 
Annual cash transfers from FIFs to implementing 
entities increased from $7.66 billion in FY2020 
to $10.03 billion in FY2021. The increase in cash 
transfers was driven by the International Finance 
Facility for Immunisation; the Global Fund to Fight 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund); 
and the Advanced Market Commitments for 
Pneumococcal Vaccines for their support in helping 
countries strengthen health systems and mitigate 
the impact of COVID-19. Cash transfers from 
FIFs include transfers for all purposes, including 
secretariat costs and administrative expenses.

Chapter 4. Financial Analytics of World Bank Group Trust Funds and FIFs
The World Bank Group is strategic in deploying 
trust fund and FIF resources to complement its own 
funding and deepen support for specific objectives 
shared by clients and donors, as well as to deliver 
timely financial responses to emergencies like the 
COVID-19 crisis. The share of FIF resources that 
the World Bank implements reflect this strategic 
alignment. Nearly one-third (28 percent) of trust fund 
disbursements for RE activities during the last five 
years have come from FIF resources implemented 
by the World Bank.
Trust fund support for advisory services that the 
Bank Group provides to public and private sector 
clients is also significant. Nearly all of IFC‚Äôs Advisory 
services and two-thirds of the World Bank‚Äôs ASA 
are funded by trust funds, allowing the Bank Group 
to build knowledge, inform policy dialogue, and 
enhance enabling environments. Trust-funded 
activities also bring World Bank Group support 
to locations outside the immediate reach of its 
financing instruments. 
ASSET MANAGEMENT
Asset management is another important way in 
which the World Bank Group brings value to trust 
fund and FIF partnerships. As trustee, the World 
Bank receives and invests development partner 
contributions to trust funds and FIFs until funds 
are disbursed to final recipients for development 
objectives. In FY2017‚Äì21, investment income earned 
on trust fund and FIF funds held in trust (FHIT) 
totaled $2.66 billion.
The trust fund and FIF portfolios have grown 
over the years due to an increase in development 
partners‚Äô contributions for multi-year projects, an 
increase in the number of trust funds managed by 
the World Bank Group, and investment returns. As 
of June 30, 2021, the amount of funds held by the 
World Bank Group trust funds and FIFs reached 
$40.24 billion. The top three IBRD/IDA programs 
with large amounts of FHIT (cash and investments) 
were the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, 
the Carbon Finance Fund, and the GFF, and the 
top three FIFs were the GCF, GEF, and the Climate 
Investment Funds.
The World Bank‚Äôs investment management services 
aim to preserve donor funds and enhance their 
value while accommodating the varying liquidity 
needs and risk preferences of different trust funds 
and FIFs. Participating funds benefit from access 
to a wide variety of investment products and longer 
terms of maturity to enhance investment returns 
over time. Environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) investment solutions and product offerings 
also cater to the sustainable responsible investing 
aspirations of participating funds. 
Dominic Chavez / World Bank
Inflows: Cash contributions to trust funds include encashment of promissory notes and cash receipts 
from donors. For FIFs, paid-in contributions include receipts in the form of cash or promissory notes, 
and other sources of funds, such as Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) and bond issuances, but 
not including investment income.
All contributions paid-in (cash and promissory notes, net of certain discounts) are reported using the 
date of receipt. It may also include contribution transfers from other trust funds. Amounts to donor 
balance and holding accounts have been excluded. From FY2017, most contributors to the Global Fund 
provided contributions directly to its secretariat, and the trustee receives these funds as contributions 
from the Global Fund Secretariat as a contributor. 
Outflows: Disbursements from trust funds and cash transfers from FIFs to implementing entities for 
development activities. For accounting purposes, FIF transfers to the World Bank as an implementing 
entity are not included in FIF disbursements but transferred and later recorded as IBRD/IDA trust fund 
disbursements.
Assets: Funds held in trust (FHIT) are comprised of cash, investments, and promissory notes 
receivable at the end of the fiscal year. ‚ÄúOther‚Äù FHIT includes amounts held in escrow on behalf of 
the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Dispute (ICSID), donor balance accounts (DBA), 
balances on administration accounts, and unapplied receipts. The total amount of DBA balances held 
was $394 million at the end of FY2021.
Externally financed outputs (EFO): Funding instrument used for activities (often research work) that 
do not exceed a 36-month timeframe and $2 million contribution limit.
Due to rounding, disbursements below $50 million are displayed as $0.00 million and other figures 
presented in this chapter may not add up to totals.

Annual Transfers to World Bank Group as an Implementing Entity by FIFs, 
FY2017‚Äì21 ($ millions) 
FIGURE 4.6
ANNUAL TRANSFERS FROM FIFS TO THE WORLD BANK GROUP AS 
IMPLEMENTING ENTITY14,15 
Transfers from FIFs to projects implemented by the World Bank Group decreased from 11 percent of the total 
transfers from FIFs to all implementing entities in FY2020 ($0.8 billion) to 8 percent in FY2021 ($0.7 billion). 
The largest transfer amounts in FY2021 were from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) at $215 million, 
followed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) at $154 million and the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) 
at $96 million. On a cumulative basis spanning FY2017‚Äì21, the World Bank Group as an implementing entity 
received the largest amount of transfers from the GPE ($1.3 billion), followed by CIF ($1.1 billion) and the Global 
Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) ($0.6 billion).
14 An implementing entity is any agency that receives funds from a FIF and is responsible for managing those funds for activities as 
approved by the governing body.
15 Transfers to implementing entities include transfers for project preparation, supervision fees, project implementation, and special 
agreement transfers for HIPC and AMC. However, in the case of the Global Fund, there is a lump sum transfer to the secretariat, and 
the use of the transferred funds is determined by the Global Fund. The GEF Secretariat acts as an implementing entity for a limited 
number of projects, i.e. the National Portfolio Formulation Exercises. Transfers to implementing entities exclude a one-time transfer 
of $383 million from the GEF to IBRD to cover reevaluation of grants denominated in Special Drawing Rights (from 2004). Non-USD 
transfers are valued as of June 30, 2021. 
4.2 OUTFLOWS
DISBURSEMENTS AND CASH 
TRANSFERS 
Total World Bank Group trust fund disbursements 
were $3.82 billion in FY2021. The marginal increase 
in disbursements and cash transfers from IBRD/IDA 
trust funds in FY2021 were mainly from the Sudan 
Transition and Recovery Support Program (up by 
$95 million) and IBRD as an implementing entity 
of the Global Partnership for Education (up by $67 
million) and the Pandemic Emergency Financing 
Facility (up by $63 million). IBRD/IDA trust funds 
accounted for 94 percent of World Bank Group 
disbursements and cash transfers from trust funds 
in FY2021, and IFC trust funds accounted for the 
remaining 6 percent.
FIFs continue to play a significant role in the 
international aid architecture. The average amount 
of annual transfers from FIFs during FY2017‚Äì21 
was $7.37 billion. The annual transfer from FIFs to 
implementing entities increased from $7.66 billion 
in FY2020 to $10.03 billion in FY2021, primarily due 
to an increase of $2.93 billion in transfers from the 
International Finance Facility for Immunisation; 
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria; and the Advanced Market Commitments for 
Pneumococcal Vaccines in response to COVID-19. 
This was offset by a decrease in transfers from the 
Climate Investment Funds, the Global Environment 
Facility, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness 
Innovations, and the Global Agriculture and Food 
Security Program.
IBRD/IDA TRUST FUND 
DISBURSEMENTS FROM TOP 20 
TRUST FUND PROGRAMS
In FY2017‚Äì21, the top 20 trust fund programs 
accounted for 63 percent of the total IBRD/IDA trust 
fund disbursements ($18.46 billion). The highest 
disbursements were made from the Afghanistan 
Reconstruction Trust Fund ($3.90 billion), followed 
by other large disbursements made by the World 
Bank in its role as implementing entity for FIFs like 
the Global Partnership for Education ($1.49 billion), 
the Climate Investment Funds ($1.08 billion) and the

ANNUAL TRANSFERS FROM FIFS TO THE WORLD BANK GROUP AS
IMPLEMENTING ENTITY‚Äú*"*>

Transfers from FIFs to projects implemented by the World Bank Group decreased from 11 percent of the total
transfers from FIFs to all implementing entities in FY2020 ($0.8 billion) to 8 percent in FY2021 ($0.7 billion).
The largest transfer amounts in FY2021 were from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) at $215 million,
followed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) at $154 million and the Climate Investment Funds (CIF)
at $96 million. On a cumulative basis spanning FY2017-21, the World Bank Group as an implementing entity
received the largest amount of transfers from the GPE ($1.3 billion), followed by CIF ($11 billion) and the Global
Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) ($0.6 billion).

4 An implementing entity is any agency that receives funds from a FIF and is responsible for managing those funds for activities as
approved by the governing body.

Transfers to implementing entities include transfers for project preparation, supervision fees, project implementation, and special
agreement transfers for HIPC and AMC. However, in the case of the Global Fund, there is a lump sum transfer to the secretariat, and
the use of the transferred funds is determined by the Global Fund. The GEF Secretariat acts as an implementing entity for a limited
number of projects, i.e. the National Portfolio Formulation Exercises. Transfers to implementing entities exclude a one-time transfer
of $383 million from the GEF to IBRD to cover reevaluation of grants denominated in Special Drawing Rights (from 2004). Non-USD
transfers are valued as of June 30, 2021.

DISBURSEMENTS AND CASH
TRANSFERS

Total World Bank Group trust fund disbursements
were $3.82 billion in FY2021. The marginal increase
in disbursements and cash transfers from IBRD/IDA
trust funds in FY2021 were mainly from the Sudan
Transition and Recovery Support Program (up by
$95 million) and IBRD as an implementing entity
of the Global Partnership for Education (up by $67
million) and the Pandemic Emergency Financing
Facility (up by $63 million). IBRD/IDA trust funds
accounted for 94 percent of World Bank Group
disbursements and cash transfers from trust funds
in FY2021, and IFC trust funds accounted for the
remaining 6 percent.

FIFs continue to play a significant role in the
international aid architecture. The average amount
of annual transfers from FIFs during FY2017-21
was $7.37 billion. The annual transfer from FIFs to
implementing entities increased from $7.66 billion
in FY2020 to $10.03 billion in FY2021, primarily due

nando Battiay/World Bank

to an increase of $2.93 billion in transfers from the
International Finance Facility for Immunisation;
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and
Malaria; and the Advanced Market Commitments for
Pneumococcal Vaccines in response to COVID-19.
This was offset by a decrease in transfers from the
Climate Investment Funds, the Global Environment
Facility, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations, and the Global Agriculture and Food
Security Program.

IBRD/IDA TRUST FUND
DISBURSEMENTS FROM TOP 20
TRUST FUND PROGRAMS

In FY2017-21, the top 20 trust fund programs
accounted for 63 percent of the total IBRD/IDA trust
fund disbursements ($18.46 billion). The highest
disbursements were made from the Afghanistan
Reconstruction Trust Fund ($3.90 billion), followed
by other large disbursements made by the World
Bank in its role as implementing entity for FIFs like
the Global Partnership for Education ($1.49 billion),
the Climate Investment Funds ($1.08 billion) and the
Global Environment Facility ($0.91 billion).

DISBURSEMENTS FROM IBRD, IDA, AND TRUST FUNDS FOR RE ACTIVITIES
Trust funds regularly co-finance IBRD and IDA projects, increasing scale and reach and filling knowledge 
and financing gaps. They provide grant financing where client countries are reluctant to borrow, reducing 
transactions costs and allowing development partners to build on World Bank Group technical and operational 
capacity to maximize impact. During the past five years, trust fund disbursements for RE activities in client 
countries have averaged 7 percent of total World Bank RE disbursements‚Äîa share that peaked at 9 percent in 
FY2017 and fell to 5 percent in FY2021. 
Total trust fund disbursements from RE activities (including stand-alone trust funds, co-financing trust funds, 
and other trust funds)18 declined by 13 percent from $2.92 billion in FY2017 to $2.55 billion in FY2021. This decline 
was primarily due to lower disbursements from the following trust fund programs: Afghanistan Reconstruction 
Trust Fund, IBRD as an implementing entity for FIFs (i.e., Global Partnership for Education, Climate Investment 
Funds, and Global Environment Facility), and the Carbon Finance Fund. IBRD and IDA disbursements also 
varied during FY2017‚Äì21, with increased disbursements in FY2021 compared to FY2020 to combat the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Stand-alone trust fund disbursements for RE activities decreased from $1.48 billion in FY2017 to $0.68 billion 
in FY2021, or 27 percent of total FY2021 trust fund disbursements for RE activities ($2.55 billion). Meanwhile, 
disbursements from co-financing trust funds continued an upward trajectory, from 36 percent ($1.04 billion) of 
total trust fund disbursements for RE activities in FY2017 to 62 percent ($1.58 billion) in FY2021. Rounding out 
FY2021 disbursements were grants that financed other lending projects ($0.26 billion).

RE grants are important financing instruments to respond to the needs of states affected by FCV. While trust 
fund disbursements for RE activities in these countries decreased in absolute amounts from $1.36 billion in 
FY2017 to $1.27 billion in FY2021, their share increased from 46 percent in FY2017 to 50 percent in FY2021. 
In FY2021, Afghanistan accounted for a significant portion (51 percent, $0.65 billion) of total trust fund 
disbursements for RE activities in states affected by FCV followed by Sudan ($119 million), the West Bank and 
Gaza ($100 million), Mozambique ($79 million), Democratic Republic of Congo ($60 million), and Somalia ($39

REGIONAL SHARES OF TRUST FUND DISBURSEMENTS FOR RE ACTIVITIES
Among the World Bank‚Äôs Regional Units, the South Asia Region (SAR) was the largest beneficiary of trust fund 
disbursements for RE activities, with $840 million in FY2021. The Eastern and Southern Africa Region (AFE) 
was the second largest beneficiary at $694 million, followed by the Western and Central Africa (AFW) at $225 
million, Latin America and Caribbean (LCR) at $221 million, East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) at $196 million, and 
Europe and Central Asia (ECA) at $152 million. 
Compared with FY2020, trust fund disbursements for RE activities in AFE increased by 21 percent in FY2021, 
primarily due to an increase in disbursement from the Sudan Transition and Recovery Support Program ($95 
million), IBRD as implementing entity for the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) ($42 million), and the 
Somalia Multi Partner Fund ($19 million). Trust fund disbursements for RE activities in SAR increased by 6

at 63 percent in FY2021. This large share of externally financed ASA provides opportunities to work with 
development partners on the knowledge agenda, while also introducing challenges to the Bank‚Äôs ability to plan 
and align its work to its strategic priorities. These challenges are being addressed as a part of the ongoing trust 
fund reforms.

4.3 ASSETS 
Trust fund assets consist of funds held in trust (FHIT)‚Äîcash, investments, promissory notes and contribution 
receivables. These assets are managed and reported separately for IBRD/IDA trust funds, IFC trust funds, and 
FIFs following established reporting protocols.
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT 
The World Bank manages the liquid assets of trust funds and FIFs in a single, commingled investment pool that 
provides the following benefits to its participants: 
‚Ä¢ A selection of sub-portfolios or model portfolios to accommodate varying liquidity needs and risk 
preferences of different funds, managed within a comprehensive risk management framework
‚Ä¢ Access to a wide variety of investment products and longer terms of maturity to enhance investment 
returns over time
‚Ä¢ Regular review of liquidity needs across funds to optimize investments over the longer term
‚Ä¢ Standardized and customized ESG investment solutions and product offerings to cater to various 
sustainable responsible investing (SRI) aspirations of individual funds
These investments earn income based on the trust fund‚Äôs share of interest income, realized gains or losses 
from the sale of securities, and unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the asset value held by the 
pool at fair value. During FY2017‚Äì21, investment income on trust fund and FIF assets totaled $2.66 billion, with 
a peak in FY2019 at $882 million and a decline in FY2021 to $201 million.

ASSET MIX OF TRUST FUNDS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 
Upon receipt of development partner contributions to a trust fund, the World Bank invests these resources in 
the international capital markets until they are disbursed to final recipients. Trust fund assets are managed with 
the primary investment objective of capital preservation and liquidity on demand. 
The provisions of the World Bank‚Äôs General Investment Authorizations for IBRD and IDA also apply to the 
investment of trust fund assets. Accordingly, these assets are managed within conservative overall risk tolerance 
parameters and invested in high quality securities, which include securities issued by sovereign governments, 
government agencies, and multilateral and other official institutions, asset-backed and agency-guaranteed 
mortgage-backed securities, as well as swaps and a range of derivatives in support of securities investments. 
Subject to the primary investment objective, the asset mix among the investment products authorized by 
the General Investment Authorizations is based on market opportunities available within the applicable risk 
limits. As part of monitoring and financial and risk management oversight, a regular rebalancing of assets is 
performed to ensure that enough liquidity is available to meet disbursements needs.
The portfolio asset allocation as of FY2021 reflects this conservative investment approach and defensive 
positioning to maintain the portfolio within the policy risk tolerance. The portfolio includes a large allocation 
of 40 percent invested in sovereign government bonds, followed by 19 percent in cash and money market 
instruments, 13 percent in corporate-covered bonds, and 12 percent in agencies. The rest of the portfolio is 
invested in sovereign government bonds, asset-backed securities, and a small allocation to equities. 
The Investment Management of World Bank Group Trust Fund offers more details about how the World Bank 
manages and invests development partner financial resources.

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND 
GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS
There has been a major shift in the global asset 
management industry toward sustainable and 
responsible investing (SRI), with rapidly growing 
awareness of global environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) issues. The World Bank Group is 
committed to a more ambitious development agenda 
focusing on the SDGs and helping client countries 
to achieve their climate action targets. The Bank 
Group takes pride in incorporating sustainability-
related themes in all operational activities, including 
the investment management function entrusted to it 
by its clients. 
Since July 2019, the World Bank Treasury has 
applied ESG Integration as the default SRI 
approach for all portfolios managed by the 
World Bank. ESG Integration explicitly considers 
material ESG factors in the investment process 
and is intended to help fulfil the existing 
investment objectives without changes to the 
current investment objectives or risk limits of the 
portfolios for which it is used. Endorsed by World 
Bank Management, ESG Integration is the most 
appropriate SRI approach within the purview of 
the IBRD/IDA General Investment Authorizations 
and clients‚Äô investment guidelines as stipulated in 
the Investment Management Agreements.
The World Bank continues to explore additional SRI 
strategies in line with the current market practices to 
meet the evolving SRI aspirations and development 
objectives of the development partners. In FY2021, 
the World Bank implemented its Sustainable Bond 
Strategy, which seeks to invest in high-grade 
bond and cash instruments that generate positive 
sustainable development impacts while retaining 
the overarching investment objectives of the trust 
funds and FIFs. The strategy is formulated based on 
three core commitments:
‚Ä¢ A focus on high-grade fixed-income investments 
aiming to generate positive impact outcomes
‚Ä¢ Fundamental fixed-income risk disciplines with 
no compromise on returns
‚Ä¢ Transparent and reliable impact reporting
The strategy is implemented following a gradual 
and phased approach, alongside the development 
of the sustainable bond market. Initially, it will focus 
on sovereign bonds, governmental agency bonds, 
and supra-national bonds through a process of 
positive identification, wherein rigorous analytical 
assessments are performed to identify bonds 
from the investable universe that have verifiable 
sustainability impact. In time, the strategy could 
adopt 
the 
same 
sustainability 
methodology 
of positive selection to a wider investment 
universe, encompassing, for example, high-grade 
corporate bonds.

FUNDS HELD IN TRUST
Funds held in trust (FHIT) are comprised of cash, investments, and promissory notes, or similar obligations, 
received but not encashed at the end of the fiscal year. It reflects, at a point in time, contributions paid-in from 
contributors and investment income earned less cash transfers from FIFs to IBRD/IDA trust funds when the 
Bank acts as implementing entity for FIFs. The top decile of the IBRD/IDA trust funds (measured by FHIT) held 
77 percent of total FHIT as of June 30, 2021. 
These trust funds broadly demonstrate a link to high priority areas, such as states affected by FCV (Afghanistan, 
West Bank and Gaza), themes (climate change), and support to the SDGs (health, nutrition, and population). 
The bottom eight deciles held 12 percent of total FHIT. While the long tail of smaller funds can provide important 
funding for innovation and knowledge, fragmentation poses challenges to linking with strategic priorities 
and achieving greater development outcomes. Small, customized trust funds may also increase transactions 
costs associated with fundraising, establishment, heterogeneous governance, results frameworks, and 
reporting requirements.

FIGURE 4.15
DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS HELD IN TRUST
As of the end of FY2021, FHIT for IBRD/IDA trust funds was $12.44 billion (including $0.09 billion of MIGA trust 
funds), an increase of 10 percent ($1.13 billion) compared to the end of FY2020. The increase was primarily due 
to larger FHIT for the Sudan Transition and Recovery Support Program ($339 million), the Global Financing 
Facility ($294 million), IBRD as an implementing entity for the Green Climate Fund ($155 million), and the 
Canada Climate Innovation Financing Facility ($138 million). The FHIT for FIFs increased by $1.8 billion (7 
percent) from $24.15 billion to $25.96 billion during FY2021. The increase was primarily due to larger FHIT for 
the Green Climate Fund ($1.69 billion), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ($863 million), 
the Global Environment Facility ($244 million), and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program 
($166 million).

4.4 EXTERNALLY FINANCED OUTPUTS
Externally financed outputs (EFOs) are funding instruments used for activities that have a finite time frame (36 
months) and an upper limit of $2 million for receiving contributions. Activities that exceed these parameters do 
not qualify for EFOs and trust funds then become the preferred instrument. EFOs can be used to support single 
or multiple bank activities or outputs that are managed by the same Vice-Presidential Unit, are part of the same 
project, and are consistent with the Bank‚Äôs work program. 
EFO CONTRIBUTIONS PAID-IN 
Total EFO contributions paid-in during FY2017‚Äì21 totaled $234 million, with the annual average contribution 
paid-in at $47 million. The FY2021 contributions paid-in decreased by 39 percent (down by $22 million) 
compared to FY2020.
Among World Bank Regions, the Eastern and Southern Africa Region (AFE) received the highest contributions 
paid-in at 15 percent ($36 million) during FY2017‚Äì21, excluding global EFOs (38 percent). Recipient countries 
such as Ethiopia, Malawi, Somalia, and Sudan received higher contributions that led to a spike in FY2019 
contributions. AFE received an annual average of $7 million and the Middle East and North Africa Region 
(MENA) received an annual average of $5 million during the five-year period.
