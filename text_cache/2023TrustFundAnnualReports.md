Foreword
We are at a critical moment in history. The world faces a perfect storm of intertwined and complex global challenges. 
For the world’s developing countries, the lingering effects of the global pandemic, slowing growth, conflict, fragility, 
food insecurity, and the urgent climate crisis all threaten to unwind development gains and plunge as many as 95 
million more people into poverty. 
The World Bank is transforming to respond to these compounding crises—fighting to preserve the hard-won 
development gains of previous decades and evolving to be a better partner to meet the most pressing needs of 
people and the planet in the future. Trust funds and financial intermediary funds (FIFs) are powerful tools for global 
development and an important part of this equation.
Trust funds and FIFs complement the World Bank’s core funding to meet critical needs, working across the 
development spectrum and delivering on the World Bank’s global challenge programs. Trust funds and FIFs have 
a powerful multiplier effect by targeting resources to issues of global concern, piloting innovative solutions for the 
most entrenched problems, developing knowledge that drives results, and allowing the World Bank to respond with 
urgency and in places otherwise out of reach.  
The evolution of the World Bank’s mission is an opportunity to further strengthen the impact of trust funds and 
FIFs. The reforms of the past five years have resulted in fewer, larger, and more strategically aligned trust funds, 
positioning them to meet this moment as they provide an established pathway for the World Bank to expand 
partnerships to increase available funds and impact. 
Partnerships play a crucial role in the success of the World Bank. Nowhere is that more prevalent than in trust funds 
and FIFs. We express gratitude to all our development partners, implementing partners, and client countries for 
their active involvement, cooperation, and commitment to our common mission and vision. As we work collectively 
to catalyze change and multiply impact in the face of cascading global crises, trust funds and FIFs are an integral 
component of the effort to end poverty and boost shared prosperity on a livable planet.

Trust Funds and FIFs at a Glance  |  IV
World Bank trust funds are financial instruments that create partnerships and platforms 
for financial, knowledge, and other collaborations around the world and across every area of 
development. They accept contributions from one or more donors and are held and disbursed 
by the World Bank as a trustee. Trust funds represent important funding sources for both clients 
and the World Bank. 
Financial intermediary funds (FIFs) are customized platforms for partnership programs and 
special financing mechanisms. They provide large-scale commingled funding through multiple 
implementing entities to address core development challenges. FIFs are typically governed by 
an independent board, with the World Bank serving as a limited trustee or treasury manager of 
26 FIFs and an implementing entity of 20.

1. Partnering through Trust Funds and FIFs  |  1
 
The world has suffered concurrent crises and 
formidable global challenges that have devastated 
many of the least developed economies and the most 
vulnerable communities. The compounding effects of 
poverty, pandemics, climate change, debt, conflict, 
food insecurity, and fragility threaten to undo decades 
of hard-won development gains. The stakes could not 
be higher—nearly 700 million people live in extreme 
poverty, and almost half the world’s population live 
on less than $6.85 a day.1 Urgent calls from across 
the international community demand that radically 
reformed and strengthened multilateral development 
banks (MDBs) led by the World Bank address these 
challenges head-on. 
The World Bank is implementing a new playbook 
committed to creating a world free of poverty on a 
livable planet. Focusing on eight global challenges 
(Box 1.1), the Bank aims to end extreme poverty and 
boost shared prosperity on a livable planet by providing 
solutions to support country priorities, address global 
challenges through country programming, and drive 
development with speed, scale, and impact. This new 
mission builds on the Bank’s country-based model 
while retrofitting its operational and financial modalities 
to mobilize more co-financing for development. Trust 
funds and financial intermediary funds (FIFs) play an 
important role in this evolution.
Trust funds and FIFs are powerful tools for global 
development. They represent some of the best 
cooperation, 
commitment, 
and 
action 
of 
the 
international community to address the world’s most 
pressing problems. They help advance progress on 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 
policy and investment priorities of middle and low-
income countries. Trust funds and FIFs are flexible, 
responsive tools in the World Bank’s comprehensive 
toolkit of policy and financial instruments, bringing 
both complementarity to Bank operations and 
targeted and customized solutions (Box 1.2).

By creating a platform for innovation, trust funds and 
FIFs often have a catalytic, outsized impact on global 
development. The highly concessionary financial 
resources provided by these instruments co-finance 
both IBRD loans and IDA credits, which helps soften 
terms for borrowing countries and makes it easier to 
pilot innovative solutions by de-risking investments 
in an efficient manner. These resources encourage 
experimentation, make space to pilot and scale up 
projects, and generate global public goods in which 
borrowing countries may be unwilling to invest without 
incentives to do so. 
Trust funds and FIFs offer tremendous flexibility. 
The tractability of trust funds, in allocation and 
implementation, enables the Bank to rapidly respond 
in times of crisis and remain engaged, especially in 
places where core lending activity is complicated. 
The flexible design of FIFs enables funds to be raised 
from multiple sources and channeled in a coordinated 
manner to address global priorities.
Trust funds and FIFs are engines of knowledge, 
contributing to a wide variety of IBRD and IDA 
projects implemented by recipients. They enable 
countries to obtain technical assistance, expertise, 
and analytics to support national development, as 
well as the administrative, knowledge, and advisory 
services provided by the World Bank staff to support 
client needs, project preparation and implementation, 
and wide-ranging global public goods. 
The World Bank’s private sector arm IFC also uses 
trust fund and FIF resources to unlock private 
sector finance for development, by establishing 
credible standards for investors, enabling financial 
innovation, and mobilizing private capital beyond 
IFC’s own account. Trust funds and FIFs support 
IFC’s continuum of expertise, ranging from analytics 
and diagnostics to advisory and to game-changing 
investment opportunities that stimulate greater private 
sector investments. 
MIGA, the World Bank’s political risk insurance 
and credit enhancement arm, also works with 
development partners to leverage its resources 
and increase the risk appetite of private investors 
in challenging environments. By collaborating with 
development 
partners 
to 
establish 
specialized 
guarantee trust funds, MIGA mobilizes guarantee 
capacity in high-risk states affected by fragility, conflict, 
and violence (FCV), where its operations would 
be limited.

The World Bank is a partner of choice for trust 
funds and FIFs. Of the 26 FIFs that the World Bank 
administrates, 18 chose to have the Bank host their 
secretariat and 20 use the Bank as an implementing 
entity. During the last five years (fiscal 2019–23), the 
World Bank has implemented $4.4 billion from these 
20 FIFs, representing 29 percent of their total funding 
provided to recipient countries and regions around the 
world. For many FIFs, the World Bank is their largest 
implementing entity.
As trustee of trust funds and FIFs under its 
management, the World Bank takes its fiduciary 
obligation seriously. It provides regular reports to 
development partners on the progress of funded 
activities and the use of trust funds, as agreed in 
legal agreements. The Bank provides a management 
assertion and an attestation from external auditors 
regarding internal controls over cash-based financial 
reporting for all cash-based trust funds, along with a 
combined financial statement for these trust funds, 
and the auditor's opinion on them.
When the World Bank engages in a trust-funded 
program, it is not simply an administrator for the 
contributing donors. Rather, the Bank brings all its 
institutional capacities to bear to achieve shared 
objectives more efficiently than one partner could 
achieve by itself. The Bank is a thought leader with 
deep technical expertise and knowledge and a 
trusted source of development data and analysis. Its 
global reach, country presence, and central place in 
international development networks mean the Bank 
can convene partners across sectors and geographic 
locations to facilitate consensus on approaches to key 
development issues and then activate operations on 
the ground. These abilities and attributes ensure trust 
fund and FIF funding is used strategically to maximize 
coordinated action and achieve impact at scale.
Nowhere has the value of trust fund partnerships been 
more evident in fiscal 2023 than in Ukraine. Since 
Russia’s invasion in February 2022, the World Bank 
and other development partners have mobilized more 
than $37.5 billion—over half of which, $19.5 billion, 
has been disbursed through World Bank trust funds.2 
Support for Ukraine is largely responsible for the 
jump in total IBRD/IDA trust fund contributions and 
disbursements, which went from $4.9 billion and $5.6 
billion, respectively, in fiscal 2022 to $22.3 billion and 
$20.7 billion, respectively, in fiscal 2023.

New trust funds were set up to deliver fast-
disbursing, targeted funding to assist the people of 
Ukraine with their immediate needs, keep institutions

and reconstruction efforts. The World Bank has 
since established the Multi-Donor Resources for 
Institutions and Infrastructure (MRII) Facility 
to coordinate IBRD/IDA, IFC, and MIGA support 
for Ukraine, including trust-funded initiatives. The 
facility takes a phased and multi-pronged approach 
to mobilizing financing and coordinating resources 
through guarantees, co- and parallel financing, and 
other financial instruments. 
Trust funds also enable international aid to flow to 
Afghanistan. Since the country’s abrupt change 
of government in August 2021, the Afghanistan 
Resilience Trust Fund (ARTF) has served as the 
central partnership platform from which the Bank has 
coordinated with development partners and donors 
and committed over $1 billion in off-budget support 
for the Afghan people. United Nations agencies and

been critical in delivering services for health and 
food security in hard-to-reach areas of Somalia 
and South Sudan. Engagement with these partners 
improves development partner coordination and 
harmonization of objectives, joint leverage in dialogue 
with government, impact, and efficiency. It dilutes 
exposure to political and reputational risks, increases 
funding predictability, and promotes robust fiduciary 
and monitoring frameworks.
International cooperation has also been essential for 
responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, with trust 
funds and FIFs playing important roles in saving 
lives, protecting the poor, maintaining education 
continuity, ensuring sustainable business growth and 
job creation, and strengthening policies, institutions, 
and investments. In the wake of the pandemic, trust-
funded research and analysis by the World Bank have 
helped cities, countries, and regions worldwide assess 
their COVID-19 response and institute reforms to build 
resilience against future pandemics by strengthening 
health care systems, vaccination protocols, and 
community outreach. 
In fiscal 2023, the World Bank used its convening 
power, knowledge, and experience to bring together 
G20 members, the World Health Organization, MDBs, 
global health institutions, and civil society to establish 
the Pandemic Fund. This new FIF answers the global 
call to augment the existing health security financing 
system and mobilize additional resources to build 
health systems and strengthen pandemic prevention, 
preparedness, and response capabilities in low and 
middle-income countries. It has raised $2 billion in 
initial contributions and issued its first call for proposals 
in February 2023. 
Also ready for action is the Scaling Climate Action 
by Lowering Emissions (SCALE) multi-partner 
umbrella trust fund initiated in fiscal 2023. The amount 
of resources required to combat climate change is 
immense, and the World Bank is working on many 
fronts to expand climate finance opportunities. SCALE 
builds on the Bank’s 20 years of experience with 
projects that generate high-quality, high-integrity 
emission reduction credits using results-based climate 
finance. This new umbrella program will pool funding 
from the global community, including donor countries, 
the private sector, and foundations, and make it 
available for the most impactful programs that reduce 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Technical advice 
and capacity strengthening provided by SCALE will 
also help countries gain the tools, knowledge, and 
experience they need to access additional private 
sector finance through international carbon markets. 
This report sheds light on these and many more trust 
fund programs that contribute to World Bank-led 
responses to overlapping global challenges, with a 
focus on climate change, pandemics, FCV, and the 
financial instability they engender. While the chapters 
are distinct, these four focus areas intersect and bring 
in other global challenges, such as energy access, 
food and nutrition security, water security and access, 
enabling digitalization, and protecting biodiversity 
and nature. 
The 52 trust-funded activities featured in this report 
and the supplemental 2023 Yearbook of Trust-
funded Results cover a five-year period from fiscal 
2019–23. These impactful activities demonstrate the 
interconnectedness of the challenges—and their 
solutions—and show how trust fund partnerships 
benefit the World Bank, its clients, and its development 
partners. For example:
• Analysis and mapping of groundwater-
dependent ecosystems in the Sahel supported 
by the Cooperation in International Waters 
in Africa (CIWA) induced countries in the 
region to initiate reforms to protect these 
essential carbon sinks, vital to rural economies, 
livelihoods, and biodiversity.
• IFC trust funds helped advance a public-
private partnership in India to develop eight

and expected to reduce 2.8 million tons of GHG 
emissions annually.

1.1 Managing Trust Funds
and FIFs

Across the World Bank, trust funds and FIFs are
managed so that their financing can be mobilized
with speed and efficiency (Table 11). Trust fund
management arrangements are designed to
enhance strategic alignment and to promote
strong internal oversight and risk management,
streamlined processes, and effective collaboration on
establishing development priorities among the Bank,
development partners, and client countries. The
World Bank also provides administrative, operational,
legal, and financial services to a diverse portfolio of
FIFs and, in many cases, acts as an implementing
entity (Annex E).

Since 2020, the World Bank has worked to transition
from a fragmented portfolio of IBRD/IDA trust fund
accounts to 72 larger and more strategically aligned

Umbrella 2.0 Programs (Annex C). These programs,
developed in consultation with the Bank's major
donors, seek to promote good oversight, greater
efficiency, and results reporting (Box 1.3). Reforms
have streamlined and harmonized governance and
management processes for better engagement,
transparency, and integration with the Bank's strategy
and planning processes while reducing transaction
costs for mutual benefit.

By targeting donor resources through fewer and

UPDATE ON TRUST FUND REFORMS
Continued engagement across the World Bank’s 
Global Practices and Regions has maintained internal 
momentum on the reforms. During fiscal 2023, four 
new umbrella programs were added and two were 
dropped resulting in a total of 72 umbrella programs, 
of which 62 are up and running. Standalone trust funds 
have been reduced by 41 percent since the baseline, 
decreasing the number to 275 at the end of fiscal 2023 
(Table 1.1).
The reforms have now entered their next phase to 
further improve the use of trust funds, including 
upstream integration of trust fund resources with the 
World Bank’s business planning processes. This is 
possible because donors in umbrella programs are 
more focused at a strategic level, enabling the Bank 
to take funding decisions for individual activities 
and projects.
In fiscal 2023, an early consultation and clearance 
process on the use of global funds at the country 
level was put in place to improve trust funds’ global-
to-country linkages. A new internal information 
platform was launched to help Bank teams working 
in operations more easily access information on 
potential umbrella program funding, whether global, 
regional, or country. 
The Bank has also started developing a more 
harmonized approach to the process of allocating 
trust fund resources in line with key principles of 
ensuring transparency, efficiency, strategic alignment, 
and management oversight. Once implemented, 
this will reduce the unnecessarily wide diversity of 
practices and support internal efficiency, oversight, 
and the integration of trust funds into the Bank’s 
business planning cycle for better whole-of-finance 
decision making.

UPDATE ON TRUST FUND REFORMS

Continued engagement across the World Bank's
Global Practices and Regions has maintained internal
momentum on the reforms. During fiscal 2023, four
new umbrella programs were added and two were
dropped resulting in a total of 72 umbrella programs,
of which 62 are up and running. Standalone trust funds
have been reduced by 41 percent since the baseline,
decreasing the number to 275 at the end of fiscal 2023
(Table 11).

The reforms have now entered their next phase to
further improve the use of trust funds, including
upstream integration of trust fund resources with the
World Bank's business planning processes. This is
possible because donors in umbrella programs are
more focused at a strategic level, enabling the Bank
to take funding decisions for individual activities
and projects.

In fiscal 2023, an early consultation and clearance
process on the use of global funds at the country
level was put in place to improve trust funds’ global-
to-country linkages. A new _ internal information
platform was launched to help Bank teams working
in operations more easily access information on
potential umbrella program funding, whether global,
regional, or country.

The Bank has also started developing a more
harmonized approach to the process of allocating
trust fund resources in line with key principles of
ensuring transparency, efficiency, strategic alignment,
and management oversight. Once implemented,
this will reduce the unnecessarily wide diversity of
practices and support internal efficiency, oversight,
and the integration of trust funds into the Bank's
business planning cycle for better whole-of-finance
decision making.

2. Tackling Climate Change  |  11
Climate change reverberates across the globe, but 
low-income countries and vulnerable communities 
suffer the most despite contributing the least to carbon 
emissions. Left unchecked, climate change could 
push 132 million people into poverty over the next 10 
years, undoing hard-won development gains.3 It could 
drive 216 million people to migrate within their own 
countries by 2050, with hotspots of internal migration 
emerging as soon as 2030.4 Extreme weather events 
caused by a changing climate have already severely 
strained crop yields and are expected to further 
damage global food supplies, especially in the world’s 
most food-insecure regions. GHG emissions that 
cause global warming continue to grow, and the world 
is not on track to meet net zero by 2050.5 
Tackling climate change is urgent and fundamental to 
the fight against poverty. The World Bank is the largest 
multilateral financier of climate action in developing 
countries. It delivered a record $38.6 billion in climate 
finance in fiscal 2023, a 22 percent increase from 
last year. Guided by its Climate Change Action Plan 
2021–2025, the Bank is mainstreaming climate into 
all its development work, ensuring that by 2025 
everything it does is aligned with the objectives of the 
Paris Agreement. 
The Bank helps countries most affected by the climate 
crisis turn their national plans, policy priorities, and 
other climate ambitions into meaningful action on 
reducing or preventing GHG emissions (mitigation) 
and adjusting to unavoidable consequences of climate 
change (adaptation). It works with both the public and 
private sectors to implement policy and regulatory 
reforms and to create incentives for investments that 
can mitigate climate change, as well as help countries 
adapt to it. Well managed, a just transition to low-
carbon development can usher in an era of green 
growth with more and better jobs, greater economic 
and climate resilience, and greater equality and 
shared prosperity.
The World Bank’s commitments for climate-related 
investments reached 41 percent of total Bank financing 
in fiscal 2023.  IBRD and IDA together delivered $29.4 
billion in climate finance, of which almost $12 billion 
supported investments in adaptation and resilience. 
This brings the Bank closer to its goal of achieving 
parity between mitigation and adaptation financing. 
IFC, which delivered $7.6 billion in total climate 
finance in fiscal 2023, and MIGA, which provided 
$1.5 billion, also continue to step up efforts to identify 
private sector investment opportunities that enhance 
adaptation and resilience. 
Trust funds and FIFs are part of this push for increased 
climate action. They play an important role in the 
provision of concessional funding to scale up climate 
investments, help countries in their quest for climate 
adaptation, and incentivize faster decarbonization. 
The World Bank uses trust funds in tandem with its 
core financing, as well as with climate-related FIFs, 
to address global climate challenges and support 
countries’ sustainable development efforts. 
The volume of recipient-executed (RE) disbursements 
from IBRD/IDA trust funds going to climate and other 
environment-related activities has increased annually 
for the last five fiscal years of 2019–23 (Figure 2.1). 
Climate-related RE investments during this time 
frame totaled $2.5 billion, of which $1.4 billion, or 
56 percent, were for mitigation activities, and $1.1 
billion, or 44 percent, were for adaptation activities 
(Figure 2.2). Two-thirds of all RE climate-related 
disbursements, or $1.7 billion, were contributed by 
development partners, while the other one-third, 
or $0.8 billion, consisted of transfers from FIFs 
implemented by IBRD/IDA. 
Twelve of the 26 FIFs administered by the Bank focus 
on climate change and environmental issues. The 
Bank acts as an implementing entity for many of 
these FIFs, including the Global Environment Facility 
(GEF), the Climate Investment Funds (CIF), and the 
Green Climate Fund (GCF). These are the three 
largest climate-related FIFs, with the GEF providing 
concessional 
funding 
for 
environment-related 
activities more broadly, and CIF and the GCF focusing 
on climate change mitigation and adaptation.

2.1 Advancing Mitigation Efforts
The World Bank prioritizes mitigation activities in the 
following five systems, which together contribute 
over 90 percent of global GHG emissions: energy; 
agriculture, food, water, and land; cities; transport; 
and manufacturing. Transforming these systems is 
key to achieving Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDC)—emission reductions that countries pledge 
to achieve under the Paris Agreement—as well as 
countries’ development goals. Trust funds are part of 
these efforts.
For instance, given green hydrogen’s promise 
as a renewable energy source that could help 
decarbonize challenging sectors, such as mining 
and transport, a technical assistance grant to Chile 
from the Spanish Fund for Latin America and the 
Caribbean (SFLAC) has played a pivotal role in 
advancing the country’s National Green Hydrogen 
Strategy. The grant enabled the Bank to provide 
valuable knowledge and policy guidance, helping to 
position Chile as a regional leader in green hydrogen. 
Furthermore, it informed the preparation of a $150 
million IBRD project approved in June 2023 to 
support the creation of a Green Hydrogen Fund.
Energy sector transformation is also underway in 
Ukraine, despite Russia’s invasion. On March 16, 2022, 
the Ukrainian power system started synchronous 
operations with the power systems of the European 
Network of Transmission System Operators for 
Electricity (ENTSO-E) after disconnection from the 
Unified Power System of Russia. The World Bank 
utilized various trust funds to support this journey 
through project investments and technical assistance.6 
Ukraine now has access to a larger reserve of power 
and one of the world’s largest integrated electricity 
markets, to which Ukraine turned to improve its energy 
security after military attacks damaged more than half 
of its power infrastructure in late 2022. Over the long 
term, the synchronization will help Ukraine unlock 
trade opportunities with the European energy market 
and competition within the domestic market, as well 
as move toward sector decarbonization. A more 
flexible power system will allow greater integration of 
renewable energy sources, thereby lessening reliance 
on fossil fuels.
In India, IFC used trust funds7 to help advance a 
public-private partnership between Rewa Ultra 
Mega Solar Ltd. and the state government of Madhya 
Pradesh to develop eight solar power parks totaling 
1,500 megawatts and expected to reduce 2.8 million 
tons of GHG emissions annually. The advisory project, 
completed in fiscal 2023, not only resulted in some 
of the lowest solar tariffs in the state, but it also 
secured Indian Railways, one of the largest electricity 
consumers in the country, as a power procurer 
alongside the state power procurement entity, MP 
Power Management Company Limited. Having a 
captive, high-quality buyer has helped to de-risk the 
generation project, and it has created an opportunity 
for the largest railway network in Asia to reduce the 
carbon footprint of its train operations.
6 The trust funds involved were Bank-implemented financing from CIF’s Clean Technology Fund (CTF), the Ukraine Second 
Power Transmission Project Single-Donor Trust Fund, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), 
the Korea Green Growth Trust Fund (KGGTF).
7 The IFC trust funds involved were the Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade – IFC Global Advisory Services 
Trust Fund, and the Infrastructure Development Collaboration Partnership Fund (DEVCO).
With support, we will be able 
to establish a fund that will 
provide financing under favorable 
long-term conditions for the 
development of projects...
and support the development of
this industry.

urban transport planning efforts more broadly. It will
also serve as a blueprint for Lima’s secondary cities
and similar World Bank projects elsewhere.

With funding from the Global Program for the
Blue Economy (PROBLUE) and in partnership with
clients, sector specialists, and scientists, the World
Bank led a_series of reports on decarbonizing the
international maritime shipping sector and harnessing
the unique business and development opportunities it
provides. This research offers insight to policymakers

of the International Maritime Organization, whose
2023 GHG reduction strategy includes a common
ambition to reach net-zero GHG emissions from
international shipping close to 2050. Other industry
and civil society players also use these World Bank
global knowledge products to make evidence-based
policy and investment decisions.

The World Bank’s climate change mitigation work also 
includes helping countries boost their public domestic 
resources for climate action. Green taxes and fossil 
fuel subsidy reforms can help countries raise revenues 
while accelerating investments in renewables, but 
such measures are underutilized. With funding from 
the Global Tax Program (GTP), the World Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) developed the 
Climate Policy Assessment Tool (CPAT). Countries 
can use CPAT to design and assess climate-smart 
tax and subsidy reform options, such as carbon taxes, 
emissions trading systems, coal excise taxes, power 
feebates, electricity excises, electricity emissions, and 
renewable subsidies. The Bank has applied the tool in 
over 30 countries, contributing to development policy 
operations (DPOs) in two countries and several World 
Bank Country Climate and Development Reports.
2.2 Adapting and Building 
Resilience to Climate Impacts 
The World Bank helps countries around the world 
adapt and build resilience to the increasingly severe 
impacts of climate change so they can better prepare 
for and withstand climate shocks. The Bank has 
committed to ensuring that half of its climate finance 
supports adaptation and resilience. Trust funds 
contribute to this goal, building partnerships and 
delivering adaptation investments that benefit people 
and communities now and long into the future.
For example, the Global Facility for Disaster 
Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) supports World 
Bank collaboration with a range of UN agencies, 
governments, and other partners to help countries 
reduce disaster risk and losses from natural disasters. 
It also serves as the World Bank’s implementing entity 
for the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems 
Initiative (CREWS)—a FIF that invests in early 
warning systems to protect lives, livelihoods, and 
assets in least-developed countries and small island 
developing states (SIDS) that are most vulnerable to 
the impact of climate and extreme weather events. 
GFDRR enables a range of World Bank technical 
support and analytical tools, such as the Global 
Rapid Post-Disaster Damage Estimation (GRADE) 
deployed in the aftermath of recent floods in Pakistan. 
The assessment directly informed the recovery 
operations and helped leverage $1.7 billion of World 
Bank financing. In Chad, the GFDRR-backed Nature-
Based Solutions Opportunity Scan identified areas in 
which nature-based solutions could reduce pluvial 
and fluvial flood risks and address urban heat in the 
capital city. This led to a $150 million IDA investment 
in N’Djamena’s urban resilience. 
Nigeria has benefitted from Bank-implemented 
funding from the Global Environment Facility 
(GEF) and its Special Climate Change Fund 
to better handle disaster risks related to erosion. 
The Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management 
Project (NEWMAP) helped to reduce soil erosion in 
targeted sub-watersheds across 23 states through 
an integrated watershed management approach. 
Some 12 million people have benefited from 
reconnected transport corridors, better access to 
markets and services, reduced flooding and siltation, 
improved storm water planning, and improved disaster 
risk preparedness.
From too much water to not enough, trust-funded 
activities help countries cope with water scarcity 
made worse by climate change. Groundwater is a 
vital freshwater resource worldwide, particularly 
in times of drought. As climate change worsens, 
policymakers need to better understand and manage 
this critical asset. The Global Water Security and 
Sanitation Partnership (GWSP) funded a new 
World Bank global flagship report entitled, The Hidden 
Wealth of Nations: The Economics of Groundwater in 
Times of Climate Change. It considers the economic 
value of groundwater, the costs of misusing it, and 
the opportunities to leverage it more effectively. The 
report offers new data and evidence to help prioritize 
groundwater across sectors and at the highest 
political level.

Community engagement is central to Mozambique’s 
Conservation Areas for Biodiversity and Development 
Project (MozBio), supported by the GEF and the 
multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) for Integrated 
Landscape Management (ILM) in Mozambique. 
Recognizing that the inclusion of women in natural 
resource management and their equal participation 
in economic and social life are essential for 
enhanced resilience, MozBio has worked closely 
with partners on gender balancing and piloting the 
Gender Action Learning System (GALS). More than 
1,000 beneficiaries have been guided through this 
step-by-step household methodology to identify and 
overcome gender barriers to economic and social 
progress. The project also supports area schools in 
implementing an environmental curriculum to raise 
youth awareness and engagement in preserving 
Mozambique’s biodiversity.
2.3 Accessing Carbon Markets 
Carbon markets could be a major source of additional 
revenue for climate action, reaching $50 billion a year 
by 2030 by some estimates.8 Market structures taking 
shape under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement hold a 
great deal of promise for incentivizing decarbonization 
efforts. Since the launch of the Clean Development 
Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol over 20 
years ago, the World Bank has worked with partners to 
create a full-fledged carbon market ecosystem—from 
setting standards for methodologies and requirements 
for third-party validation, to verification and reporting, 
to benefit-sharing arrangements so proceeds go to 
communities involved in reducing emissions.
World Bank trust funds have played a strategic role in 
this work, piloting results-based climate and carbon 
finance mechanisms that deliver payments once pre-
agreed targets have been achieved—namely, verified

emission reductions (or carbon credits) that meet 
the World Bank’s highest environmental, accounting, 
and social inclusion standards. The promise of future 
payout is a strong incentive for action on the ground, 
and payments signal to other potential investors and 
buyers that real progress is being made in reducing 
emissions. To ensure success, trust funds provide 
technical assistance and capacity building so 
stakeholders have the necessary tools and training 
to generate, verify, and monetize their emission 
reductions. The process enables countries to build the 
expertise and systems needed to access international 
and regional carbon markets and sell excess carbon 
credits over the long term.
Building on these two decades of experience, the 
World Bank is preparing to roll out its new Scaling 
Climate Action by Lowering Emissions (SCALE) 
umbrella multi-partner trust fund. SCALE brings 
together all results-based climate and carbon financing 
programs currently housed at the World Bank into a 
one-stop-shop. It is designed to complement up-front 
activity-based finance with results-based payments of 
$40-60 million per project, supporting decarbonization 
across a broad range of sectors. SCALE also provides 
technical advice and capacity building and serves 
as an instrument for policy dialogue and broader 
engagement to incentivize low-carbon development. 
In addition, SCALE’s benefit-sharing arrangements 
are designed with broad stakeholder consultation 
to ensure that all project participants, including 
Indigenous Peoples and local communities, are 
recognized and rewarded for their role in driving 
low-carbon transitions. The Enhancing Access to 
Benefits while Lowering Emissions (EnABLE) 
MDTF will work in tandem with SCALE to further 
promote social inclusion of marginalized communities 
and disadvantaged groups, such as women, youth, 
and people with disabilities.

Looking back over the last five years, the following 
trust-funded activities offer insight into the power 
and potential of results-based payments to stimulate 
greater and faster decarbonization in a variety of 
settings and sectors.
For example, in Brazil, the Carbon Partnership 
Facility (CPF) worked with the country’s second-
largest public bank, CAIXA, to provide financing to 
incentivize reductions in methane emissions from 
decomposing trash. Methane is a powerful GHG and 
the second-largest driver of global climate change. The 
world’s cities generate more than a billion tons of solid 
waste each year. Under this project, improvements to 
four landfills generated emission reduction payments 
of €23.7 million between 2013 and 2020, and captured 
over 175 million cubic meters of methane, equivalent 
to 3.5 million tons of CO2 emissions. 
Supported by $18 million in grants from the 
BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest 
Landscapes (ISFL), Ethiopia’s Oromia Forested 
Landscape Program combines agriculture, livestock, 
and forestry to address climate change at the 
landscape level. By targeting the Oromia region, home 
to over 30 million people and 52 percent of Ethiopia's 
forests, the program plays a central role in advancing 
the country's climate resilience agenda. In February 
2023, a milestone was met with the signing of an 
Emission Reductions Purchase Agreement (ERPA). 
ISFL agrees to pay up to $40 million for the reduction 
of approximately 4 million tonnes of GHG emissions 
by 2030 through forest preservation and sustainable 
land management practices in the program area. 
Our village is no longer 
threatened by deforestation. We 
are reforesting the bare lands and 
sustainably managing the existing 
ones. We have seen how the 
microclimate is changing and the 
income-generating activities are 
benefiting us.

The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) 
has also signed ERPAs with 15 countries, including 
Indonesia. For over a decade, the FCPF has supported 
Indonesia in developing its first-ever jurisdictional-level 
program for reducing emissions from deforestation 
and forest degradation (REDD+), including signing an 
ERPA to uphold the program’s implementation. The 
FCPF will pay $110 million for the reduction of 22 million 
tons of GHG emissions across 12.7 million hectares 
of land rich in tropical rainforests and biodiversity. 
In fiscal 2023, Indonesia received an advance ERPA 
payment of $20.9 million, which represents 14 percent 
of the value of the emission reductions reported in the 
government’s monitoring report for the 2019–2020 
crediting period. With the FCPF, the government is 
exploring various carbon finance scenarios, including 
carbon markets and a domestic carbon exchange, as 
it expects to generate excess emission reductions. 
While carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris 
Agreement have the potential to unlock climate 
finance, they will only be effective in limiting 
global warming if the carbon credits transacted 
are real, credible, and accurately accounted for 
and tracked. The Carbon Finance Assist Trust 
Fund (Carbon-Assist) and the Partnership for 
Market Implementation Facility (PMIF) helped 
finance the development of the Climate Action 
Data (CAD) Trust, an open-source global platform 
that connects, aggregates, and harmonizes carbon 
credit data. CAD Trust enhances transparency 
and trust in carbon markets by harmonizing data 
formats and connecting disparate carbon registry 
systems. The Government of Singapore and the 
International Emissions Trading Association also 
support the platform, whose overarching goal is to 
strengthen reporting compliance requirements and 
implementation of NDCs.
2.4 Incentivizing 
the Private Sector 
The private sector has a key role to play in helping 
address the climate challenge, as economic stresses 
and multiple crises strain the ability of governments to 
make the necessary investments to mitigate and adapt 
to climate change. With the support of trust funds, the 
World Bank offers climate expertise across industries 
and sectors, combined with a deep understanding 
of emerging markets and a practical outlook, to 
help private sector clients be competitive in the new 
climate economy. The Bank helps governments build 
expertise to work with their private sectors on climate-
oriented growth, as firms develop decarbonization 
plans and financial institutions work to increase their 
share of climate investments. 
For example, trust funds from Germany helped launch 
the World Bank’s Scaling Up Climate Finance through 
Greening the Financial Sector—or 30 by 30 Zero 
Program—in the Philippines. It is one of four countries 
targeted by the program, which aims to increase climate 
lending to 30 percent of participating banks’ portfolios 
by 2030. Work led by IFC is underway to tackle the 
regulatory and institutional constraints facing financial 
institutions, develop the market for climate thematic 
bonds, and build capacity and coordination for climate 
finance. By 2030, the program is also expected to assist 
the Philippines in aligning financial sector strategies 
and reforms with the implementation of new NDCs 
and raise at least $400 million of climate funding from 
IFC to local banks, and another $250 million through 
the introduction of climate thematic bonds issued by 
real sector companies to the capital markets.
As a bank known for its 
commitment to sustainable 
finance and climate change 
mitigation, we are delighted that 
IFC has entrusted us with this 
significant investment.

In conjunction with the 30 by 30 Zero Program, 
technical assistance and advisory service grants from 
the Climate Support Facility (CSF) have contributed 
to financial sector reforms in the Philippines. The 
World Bank provided guidance on developing a 
green taxonomy and incentives for green investments 
within the country’s central bank and its Securities 
Commission, as well as on incorporating climate and 
environmental risks into financial institutions’ risk 
management frameworks and the country’s Insurance 
Code reform. This support enabled the government to 
implement a series of sustainable development policy 
actions under three DPOs approved in 2022 and 2023, 
together totaling $1.75 billion.
Trust fund and FIF financing help the Bank employ a 
range of instruments to de-risk high-impact climate 
projects in low and middle-income countries. For 
example, bespoke guarantee offerings provided by 
MIGA ease private sector investments in renewable 
energy development, including generation capacity, 
mini-grid systems, transmission systems, and battery 
storage. The Renewable Energy Catalyst Trust 
Fund (RECTF) provides a variety of risk mitigation 
and capacity tools toward this end, such as a first-
loss facility, reinsurance, guarantee tenor extension, 
financial grants, and soon, liquidity support. MIGA 
has so far used the RECTF for two guarantee projects, 
together amounting to $9.3 million in issuance 
of guarantees.
In 2022, the World Bank issued the Wildlife 
Conservation Bond (WCB) in support of South 
Africa’s efforts to conserve endangered species. Also 
known as the “Rhino Bond,” this five-year $150 million 
sustainable development bond includes a potential 
performance payment from the GEF, which will 
contribute to protecting and increasing black rhino 
populations in protected areas of South Africa. The 
WCB channels private sector investments to achieve 
conservation outcomes, while bringing jobs to local 
communities. Drawing on this model, in 2023, the 
World Bank priced a five-year $50 million, principal-
protected emission reduction-linked bond that 
mobilized private capital to increase financing for low-
carbon solutions in developing countries.
IFC uses blended finance, in which concessional 
funds from partners are blended with IFC’s own 
financing, to de-risk climate investments. A disciplined 
approach to deploying concessional funds minimizes 
the level of subsidy to avoid distorting markets and 
allows the crowding-in of other commercial financiers. 
For example, IFC invested $100 million in Egypt's 
first-ever private sector green bond to unlock finance 
for climate-smart projects, reduce GHG emissions, 
and support the country's energy transition. The 
bond will help Egypt's Commercial International 
Bank (CIB) increase lending to businesses investing 
in eco-friendly initiatives that are still nascent in 
Egypt, including green buildings, renewable energy, 
and energy efficiency. The project will benefit from 
$1.4 million in funding from the blended finance 
component of the UK-IFC Market Accelerator for 
Green Construction (MAGC) trust fund through 
performance-based incentives to motivate developers 
to construct certified green buildings.
Blended finance has helped Vietnam launch the 
development of a first-of-its-kind modern waste-to-
energy plant in Bac Ninh province to increase municipal 
solid waste treatment capacity, which currently hovers 
around 50 percent. The project includes a $15 million 
concessional loan from the Finland-IFC Blended 
Finance for Climate Program. By introducing an 
environmentally sound waste treatment and disposal 
solution, the plant will help avoid health and safety 
issues related to soil and groundwater contamination. 
Technology plays a powerful role in stimulating 
climate-smart innovations and investments. The 
World Bank serves as the trustee for AgResults 
Initiative, a FIF that uses pay-for-results prize 
competitions to incentivize the private sector to 
help develop, deliver, and scale up technologies 
that enhance productivity for smallholder farmers. 
One such competition in Vietnam sought to identify 
novel approaches for reducing GHG emissions and 
increasing yields in rice cultivation throughout South 
and Southeast Asia.

In conjunction with the 30 by 30 Zero Program,
technical assistance and advisory service grants from
the Climate Support Facility (CSF) have contributed
to financial sector reforms in the Philippines. The
World Bank provided guidance on developing a
green taxonomy and incentives for green investments
within the country’s central bank and its Securities
Commission, as well as on incorporating climate and
environmental risks into financial institutions’ risk
management frameworks and the country’s Insurance
Code reform. This support enabled the government to
implement a series of sustainable development policy
actions under three DPOs approved in 2022 and 2023,
together totaling $1.75 billion.

Trust fund and FIF financing help the Bank employ a
range of instruments to de-risk high-impact climate
projects in low and middle-income countries. For
example, bespoke guarantee offerings provided by
MIGA ease private sector investments in renewable
energy development, including generation capacity,
mini-grid systems, transmission systems, and battery
storage. The Renewable Energy Catalyst Trust
Fund (RECTF) provides a variety of risk mitigation
and capacity tools toward this end, such as a first-
loss facility, reinsurance, guarantee tenor extension,
financial grants, and soon, liquidity support. MIGA
has so far used the RECTF for two guarantee projects,
together amounting to $9.3 million in issuance
of guarantees.

In 2022, the World Bank issued the Wildlife
Conservation Bond (WCB) in support of South
Africa’s efforts to conserve endangered species. Also
known as the “Rhino Bond; this five-year $150 million
sustainable development bond includes a potential
performance payment from the GEF, which will
contribute to protecting and increasing black rhino
populations in protected areas of South Africa. The
WCB channels private sector investments to achieve
conservation outcomes, while bringing jobs to local
communities. Drawing on this model, in 2023, the
World Bank priced a five-year $50 million, principal-
protected emission reduction-linked bond that
mobilized private capital to increase financing for low-
carbon solutions in developing countries.

IFC uses blended finance, in which concessional
funds from partners are blended with IFC’s own
financing, to de-risk climate investments. A disciplined
approach to deploying concessional funds minimizes
the level of subsidy to avoid distorting markets and
allows the crowding-in of other commercial financiers.
For example, IFC invested $100 million in Egypt's
first-ever private sector green bond to unlock finance
for climate-smart projects, reduce GHG emissions,

3. Strengthening Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response  |  23
When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, the 
World Bank mounted the fastest and largest financial 
response in its history to help countries respond to, and 
recover from, the crisis. Working together, the global 
community brought the pandemic under control, but 
not before it led to nearly 7 million reported deaths9 and 
total expected economic losses estimated at nearly 
$14 trillion through the end of 2023.10 The recovery 
has been highly uneven, leaving behind some of the 
poorest countries.
As of June 30, 2023, the World Bank committed $270 
billion of financial support to help public and private 
sector clients overcome the wide-ranging health and 
socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Bank’s response has helped to save lives, protect 
poor and vulnerable people, maintain education 
continuity, ensure sustainable business growth and 
job creation, and strengthen policies, institutions, and 
investments. The COVID-19 crisis has also spurred 
collective action to augment the existing global health 
security financing system and to mobilize additional 
resources to build health systems and strengthen 
capacity for pandemic prevention, preparedness, 
and response.
To that end, the Bank facilitated the creation of a 
new FIF, the Pandemic Fund, in September 2022. 
It provides a dedicated stream of additional, long-
term financing to strengthen pandemic prevention, 
preparedness, and response capabilities in low 
and middle-income countries through investments 
and technical support at the national, regional, 
and global levels. The fund raised $2 billion in seed 
capital from 25 donors and issued its first call for 
proposals in February 2023. The World Bank brought 
its convening power, knowledge, and experience to 
leading the development and operationalization of the 
Pandemic Fund at record speed, collaborating with 
G20 members and beyond, the WHO, and a variety 
of other stakeholders, including MDBs, global health 
institutions, and civil society. The Bank hosts the 
Pandemic Fund’s secretariat, and serves as trustee 
and one of the fund’s implementing entities.
This new Pandemic Fund and other trust funds and FIFs 
have played important roles in the Bank’s COVID-19 
pandemic response and larger efforts to strengthen 
health systems. Between fiscal 2019 to 2023, IBRD/
IDA trust funds disbursed $1.2 billion of RE grants 
toward pandemic prevention, preparedness, and 
response. These disbursements peaked in fiscal 2021 
during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 
3.1) and surpassed health-related RE disbursements 
that year. This is because the World Bank’s response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic extended beyond health-
related activities, and still does.  
A key contributor is the Health Emergency 
Preparedness and Response Umbrella Program 
(HEPR), established by the World Bank in June 
2020 to help countries respond to the pandemic 
and prepare for future health emergencies. During 
its first two years, HEPR mobilized $211 million in 
resources and allocated $126 million through June 
2023 to support 45 country and regional efforts 
in health emergency preparedness and response. 
These resources have co-financed IDA investments, 
provided funds to countries not eligible for IDA 
resources, supported regional efforts to strengthen 
cross-border health emergency preparedness, and 
created a global effort to build the evidence needed 
to identify the most impactful health emergency 
preparedness and response efforts.
To save lives, for example, HEPR helped the Solomon 
Islands extend its COVID-19 vaccine deployment 
efforts to hard-to-reach areas in its archipelago of 
six major islands and more than 900 smaller islands. 
The HEPR grant provided funds to purchase boats, 
vehicles, and safety equipment to reach remote 
communities, and to conduct a communication 
and advocacy campaign to combat misinformation 
about COVID-19 vaccines. To help prepare for future 
pandemics, HEPR funding has enabled countries 
in Eastern Africa to strengthen their internal health 
systems and create more effective cross-border 
surveillance and response networks. In just nine 
months in 2022, the completeness and timeliness

3.1 Improving Health Systems 
and Regional Cooperation 
Immediate COVID-19 response measures have largely 
given way to longer-term investments in pandemic 
prevention and preparedness. This comprises many 
elements, including strong and resilient health 
systems, particularly for primary care, to facilitate 
the detection of disease outbreaks, provide essential 
care, and support the deployment of vaccines and 
other medical countermeasures. The COVID-19 crisis 
laid bare long-standing weaknesses in pandemic 
preparedness in many countries, especially low and 
middle-income countries. World Bank trust funds bring 
technical knowledge, advice, and analysis to countries 
to help them strengthen their national systems and 
regional cooperation. 
The Bank’s work on pandemic preparedness 
involves One Health, a collaborative approach that 
brings animal, environmental, and public health 
sectors together to prevent, detect, respond to, and 
recover from infectious diseases. With support from 
Food Systems 2030, the World Bank is focused on 
embedding the One Health approach across the 
institution and in regions worldwide. This includes 
Central Asia, where advisory and analytical work

provides an investment roadmap for the region 
still struggling with the economic impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2022, five Central 
Asian countries signed a joint communiqué agreeing 
to adopt the framework, including establishing 
governance structures and engaging in joint resource 
mobilization, data sharing, and preparatory work to 
implement national and regional activities.

and strengthening regional and 
cross-sectoral collaboration.

and Zoonotic Diseases, WHO
Overall, countries with universal and progressive 
health coverage were better equipped to mitigate the 
negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Côte d’Ivoire, for example, was able to draw on an 
ongoing IDA project and technical assistance from 
the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children 
and Adolescents (GFF) that had rolled out a 
universal health coverage program to make services 
more affordable to communities. Between 2019 and 
2021, over 3.5 million individuals were enrolled in 
the health insurance program, representing an 89 
percent increase in three years. Beginning in 2020, 
the government targeted individuals working in the 
informal sector, many of them women, by encouraging 
them to register for an insurance card. This also 
helped mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic. By the end of 2021, 20 percent of all insured 
individuals were informal sector workers.
Egypt had just embarked on a path toward universal 
health coverage before the COVID-19 outbreak. 
Experiences during the pandemic underscored 
the benefits that would flow if Egypt could broaden 
access to safe and quality health care. IFC used the 
MENA Private Sector Development Trust Fund to 
launch the Egypt Health Quality Advisory Program 
to support private health care service providers 
across the country in enhancing patient safety 
practices and upgrading their quality assurance 
systems. The project has assessed and advised 100 
health care facilities across 15 governorates, which 
have used recommendations to improve processes 
and training to meet national and international 
accreditation standards.
IFC trust funds11 have also assisted local governments 
in assessing their response to COVID-19 to identify 
challenges and successes, lessons learned, and 
ways to future-proof their response capacity. In the 
Philippines, for example, Quezon City was one of 
the worst-affected cities due to its high population 
density, poor urban communities, inadequate health 
infrastructure, and limited government capacity. 
The IFC health advisory team 
visit was useful. They helped 
us identify, measure, and 
assess areas for performance 
improvement and helped build 
staff capabilities through their 
comprehensive training program 
for quality managers.

Health approach in Central Asia
and strengthening regional and
cross-sectoral collaboration.

— Peter Sousa Hoejskov, Technical Officer on Food Safety
and Zoonotic Diseases, WHO

Overall, countries with universal and progressive
health coverage were better equipped to mitigate the
negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Céte d'Ivoire, for example, was able to draw on an
ongoing IDA project and technical assistance from
the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children
and Adolescents (GFF) that had rolled out a
universal health coverage program to make services
more affordable to communities. Between 2019 and
2021, over 3.5 million individuals were enrolled in
the health insurance program, representing an 89
percent increase in three years. Beginning in 2020,
the government targeted individuals working in the
informal sector, many of them women, by encouraging
them to register for an insurance card. This also
helped mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic. By the end of 2021, 20 percent of all insured
individuals were informal sector workers.

Egypt had just embarked on a path toward universal
health coverage before the COVID-19 outbreak.
Experiences during the pandemic underscored
the benefits that would flow if Egypt could broaden
access to safe and quality health care. IFC used the
MENA Private Sector Development Trust Fund to
launch the Egypt Health Quality Advisory Program
to support private health care service providers
across the country in enhancing patient safety
practices and upgrading their quality assurance
systems. The project has assessed and advised 100
health care facilities across 15 governorates, which
have used recommendations to improve processes
and training to meet national and_ international
accreditation standards.

IFC trust funds" have also assisted local governments
in assessing their response to COVID-19 to identify
challenges and successes, lessons learned, and
ways to future-proof their response capacity. In the
Philippines, for example, Quezon City was one of
the worst-affected cities due to its high population
density, poor urban communities, inadequate health
infrastructure, and limited government capacity.

The IFC health advisory team
visit was useful. They helped

us identify, measure, and

assess areas for performance
improvement and helped build
staff capabilities through their
comprehensive training program
for quality managers.

— Mahmoud Mourad, Quality Manager,
Rofayda Hospital, Egypt

(DFAT)-IFC Global Advisory Services Trust Fund.

The Quezon City COVID-19 Advisory Support 
Project identified the need to invest in better data 
management and reconfigure the city’s COVID-19 
testing and vaccination response to address broader 
public health needs. The Quezon City government

World Bank research funded by the Canada-
Caribbean Resilience Facility (CCRF) has garnered 
lessons learned on pandemic preparedness and 
responsiveness in the Caribbean, particularly on 
COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake. Eight 
out of 20 countries in the region were still below 
a 50 percent vaccination rate as of March 2023. 
Phone and social media surveys conducted across 
multiple countries revealed distrust and concerns 
around the risks of vaccines with few perceived 
benefits. The research has led to several knowledge

vaccine deployment in Caribbean countries and 
recommendations for improving community outreach 
and vaccine promotion strategies.

and Manufacturing 
Through its private sector arm, IFC, the World 
Bank invests in initiatives to build up local vaccine, 
pharmaceutical, and health-related manufacturing 
capabilities in emerging markets to strengthen 
domestic capacity to prepare for and respond to future 
pandemics. IFC projects aim to improve the quality 
and accessibility of health products and help clients 
seize economic opportunities in medical equipment 
and pharmaceutical production. 
In particular, the IFC-led Global Health Platform 
(GHP) has helped countries respond quickly to 
COVID-19 disruptions in the short-term and continues 
to drive long-term change in the health sector. The 
platform generated close to $2 billion in investment

3.3 Facilitating FIF 
Contributions
The response of the international development 
community to the COVID-19 pandemic has benefitted 
greatly from the large-scale contributions of health-
related FIFs to save lives and protect the most 
vulnerable. FIFs have contributed not only to the 
immediate crisis response by delivering vaccines and 
other health supplies to millions of people around 
the world, but also to strengthening health systems 
and enhancing preparedness for future pandemics. 
In addition to creating the new Pandemic Fund in 
September 2022 and facilitating its development 
and launch in record speed, the World Bank provides 
indispensable 
administrative, 
operational, 
legal, 
and financial services to the following FIFs, which 
are making important contributions to COVID-19 
health responses.
The 
Coalition 
for 
Epidemic 
Preparedness 
Innovations (CEPI) brings together public and 
private sector entities, philanthropies, and civil 
society organizations to develop vaccines to stop 
future epidemics. The World Bank serves as a limited 
financial trustee. CEPI supports the world’s largest 
portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines and is the only public 
sector funder of research and development that has 
systematically leveraged its investments to enable 
equitable access to vaccines, guaranteeing access 
to doses for the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access 
(COVAX) initiative. Working through the World Bank 
and other partners, COVAX distributed almost 2 billion 
doses of COVID-19 vaccines to 146 countries by 
November 2022. CEPI continues to invest in the next 
generation of vaccines against COVID-19 variants and 
other coronaviruses.
access to quality health care, accelerate digital 
transformation in health care and pharmaceutical 
companies, expand and diversify medical equipment 
manufacturing, and develop financing options for 
medical equipment acquisitions.
For example, GHP trust funds enabled technical 
advice to seven private sector clients in Africa, Asia, 
and the Middle East on manufacturing masks, gowns, 
and other personal protection equipment (PPE). IFC 
advised manufacturers on PPE production standards, 
connected them to potential buyers and global PPE 
procurement efforts, and shared market analysis. 
The program also served as a global platform to 
share knowledge on PPE, including global and 
regional market trends, international standards and 
certifications, PPE waste and circularity, PPE fit for 
women health care workers, and workers’ health and 
safety during PPE production.
The trust-funded Africa Medical Equipment Facility 
(AMEF) supports the acquisition of medical equipment 
by smaller health care enterprises, including hospitals, 
clinics, pathology laboratories, diagnostic imaging 
centers, and medical equipment distributors in 
Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, 
Tanzania, and Uganda. AMEF’s client banks have 
approved the first six medical equipment loans. In 
partnership with the Government of Norway and 
under the umbrella of the GHP, IFC also launched the 
Women’s Leadership in Private Healthcare working 
group, which brings together senior women leaders 
from 17 health care organizations in Africa, East Asia, 
and the Middle East and North Africa to identify and 
address barriers to women’s leadership in the field.
IFC’s efforts to raise standards in private health care 
include work on the Healthcare Quality Assessment 
Tool and the Ethical Principles in Health Services 
(EPiHC), both supported by donors through the 
GHP. The Healthcare Quality Assessment Tool aims

(backed by binding pledges from donor countries) 
that provide immediate funding for Gavi, the Vaccine 
Alliance, to purchase and distribute vaccines. With 
the World Bank serving as treasury manager to 
enable these transactions, IFFIm has played a critical 
role in frontloading donor pledges to help fund the 
purchase of COVID-19 vaccines. Since the start of 
the pandemic, IFFIm has disbursed $980 million to 
Gavi for the COVAX, as well as $272 million to Gavi for 
vaccine development. 
The World Bank is also the trustee of the Global 
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. 
Over the span of 20 years, the Global Fund has 
invested more than $55.4 billion across 100 countries 
to save 50 million lives and reduce the combined 
death rate from these three diseases by more than 
half in the countries where it invests. The Global 
Fund’s COVID-19 response amounted to $5 billion 
that supported 109 countries and 22 multi-country 
programs, by procuring medical supplies and 
protecting front-line health workers with training 
and PPE.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused the worst disruption 
to education in decades, leading to prolonged 
school closures and exacerbating the learning 
crisis and human capital development challenges. 
The Global Partnership for Education (GPE), 
for which the World Bank is the trustee, host, and 
largest implementing entity, provided approximately 
$500 million in accelerated funding and COVID-19 
grants to help partner country governments plan and 
implement emergency responses. Funding focused 
on preventing the negative impacts of COVID-19 
on education, ensuring continued learning for 
children, preventing the spread of COVID-19 in and 
through schools, and supporting vulnerable groups, 
especially girls.

By 2030, nearly 59 percent of the world’s extreme poor 
will live in countries affected by fragility, conflict, and 
violence (FCV). This sobering projection reveals the 
challenges extend well beyond Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine, fighting in Sudan, and other headline news. 
Rising inequality, lack of opportunity, discrimination, 
and exclusion fuel the spike in violent conflict seen 
across the world since 2010. Governments often lack 
the capacity or will to manage risks, thus making 
institutions and people more vulnerable to economic 
shocks, natural disasters, and global challenges and 
regional spillovers, such as the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the influx of refugees from war-torn areas. As 
conflicts continue across the globe, the number of 
people displaced by them has reached record levels. 
Of the more than 108 million forcibly  displaced persons 
worldwide, an estimated 76 percent are hosted in low 
and middle-income countries, often by communities 
facing their own socio-economic challenges.13
Responding to fragility, conflict, and violence is key 
to attaining the SDGs and a priority of the World 
Bank, as articulated in its 2020–2025 FCV Strategy. 
A record $30 billion in financing for FCV-affected 
countries was approved in December 2021 under 
IDA’s 20th replenishment to meet diverse challenges 
in the poorest countries. The World Bank’s response to 
hotspots like Afghanistan and Ukraine has been rapid 
and effective, with trust funds playing key roles. 
Following Afghanistan’s abrupt change in government 
in August 2021, the Afghanistan Resilience 
Trust Fund (ARTF), formerly the Afghanistan 
Reconstruction Trust Fund, has enabled the World 
Bank to provide over $1 billion in off-budget support 
to deliver essential food, livelihood, health, water, 
and education services to the Afghan people and 
to build the capacity of local NGOs and civil society 
organizations. The World Bank’s new funding 
modality channels funding through United Nations 
agencies and the Aga Khan Foundation to implement 
all operations. These activities aim to address 
basic services and pave the way for development 
in Afghanistan's complex environment. ARTF also 
supports on-the-ground surveys, data collection, and 
analytics that give the Afghan people a voice and help 
shape the international community’s humanitarian-
development response in this FCV context. 
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, 
the World Bank and other development partners 
have mobilized more than $37.5 billion for Ukraine 
through June 30, 2023, of which over $19.5 billion 
has been disbursed through IBRD/IDA trust funds. 
While trust funds consistently devote a large share of 
their resources to projects in countries on the World 
Bank’s official list of fragile and conflict-affected 
situations, RE disbursements for FCV-affected states 
climbed to 94 percent of total RE disbursements in 
fiscal 2023, largely due to support for Ukraine (Figure 
4.1). RE disbursements for FCV-affected states from 
fiscal 2019–23 totaled $25.3 billion and 77 percent of 
this went to Ukraine through standalone trust funds 
for the country’s economic recovery (Figure 4.2).
This huge increase from previous years’ disbursements 
reflects the shared commitment of the World Bank 
and development partners to support Ukraine through 
urgent repair projects and coordination with the 
government for recovery and reconstruction. These 
figures also show that trust funds have been a vehicle 
of choice to deliver fast-disbursing, targeted funding 
where it is needed most. Immediately after Russia’s 
invasion began, the World Bank established two 
multi-donor trust funds in fiscal 2022 to provide $2.5 
billion in grant co-financing to two Bank operations: 
the Financing of Recovery of Economic Emergency 
(FREE) Ukraine Supplemental DPO, approved in March 
2022, and the Public Expenditures for Administrative 
Capacity Endurance (PEACE) in Ukraine Project, 
approved in June 2022.

The FREE operation provided an immediate platform 
for the Bank to work with Ukraine’s development 
partners and mobilize additional resources on top of 
$484 million in IBRD financing, including $134 million 
backed by guarantees. Bilateral donors (Austria, 
Denmark, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States) contributed 
grant financing for an additional $1.2 billion through 
the FREE Multi-donor Trust Fund within two 
weeks of Russia’s invasion.14 Together, $2.25 billion in 
emergency budget financing was mobilized to 
help meet the immediate social and fiscal needs 
precipitated by the invasion. 
The PEACE project has raised $19.7 billion in World 
Bank and trust fund resources to sustain support for an 
estimated 13 million Ukrainians. The bulk, $17.9 billion, 
has already been disbursed, benefitting 10 million 
pensioners, 500,000 education employees, 145,000 
government employees, 56,000 first responders, and 
over 3 million social assistance beneficiaries and 
internally displaced people. 
In December 2022, the World Bank launched the 
Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction and 
Reform Trust Fund (URTF) for Ukraine’s immediate 
repairs and recovery efforts. The trust fund has received 
contributions and pledges from Austria, Canada, 
Iceland, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, 
Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland totaling $1.1 billion. 
The URTF is a coordinated financing and support 
mechanism to assist the Government of Ukraine in 
sustaining its administrative and service delivery 
capacity, conducting relief efforts, and planning 
and implementing its recovery, reconstruction, and 
reform agenda. 
The World Bank has since established the Multi-Donor 
Resources for Institutions and Infrastructure 
(MRII) Facility to coordinate IBRD, IFC, and MIGA 
efforts for Ukraine. The PEACE project and the 
URTF now fall under the MRII Facility, as does IFC’s 
Economic Resilience Action (ERA) program and other

4.1 Addressing the Drivers 
of FCV
The Bank supports countries at every stage of fragility, 
working to prevent violent conflict and interpersonal 
tensions before they turn into full-blown crises, but 
also remaining engaged during conflict and crisis 
to preserve hard-won development gains, protect 
essential institutions, and build resilience so countries 
are set on the course for recovery. Trust funds help 
enable this work with resources to tackle the root 
causes of FCV in various contexts and promote peace 
and stability.
In particular, the State and Peacebuilding Fund 
(SPF) is the World Bank’s leading global trust fund for 
implementing the Bank’s FCV Strategy. SPF provides 
catalytic financing to help address drivers of fragility, 
prevent conflict, activate rapid crisis response, and 
build long-term resilience. SPF’s mandate is to innovate 
and push the frontiers of the Bank’s engagement in 
FCV situations through activities that can be scaled 
and mainstreamed. SPF provides seed funding for 
pilots, tools, and analytical work that inform larger 
World Bank projects. 
For example, SPF funded a Survivor-centered 
Accessibility Framework Evaluation (SAFE) along 
migratory routes in Central America. The research 
has helped to fill knowledge gaps about the violence 
women and girls experience in their home countries 
and during their journeys along common migratory 
routes, thereby influencing World Bank operations 
on safe migration and survivor services for migrant 
women in Central America.

The FREE operation provided an immediate platform
for the Bank to work with Ukraine’s development
partners and mobilize additional resources on top of
$484 million in IBRD financing, including $134 million
backed by guarantees. Bilateral donors (Austria,
Denmark, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, the
United Kingdom, and the United States) contributed
grant financing for an additional $1.2 billion through
the FREE Multi-donor Trust Fund within two
weeks of Russia's invasion.’ Together, $2.25 billion in
emergency budget financing was mobilized to
help meet the immediate social and fiscal needs
precipitated by the invasion.

The PEACE project has raised $19.7 billion in World
Bank and trust fund resources to sustain support for an
estimated 13 million Ukrainians. The bulk, $17.9 billion,
has already been disbursed, benefitting 10 million
pensioners, 500,000 education employees, 145,000
government employees, 56,000 first responders, and
over 3 million social assistance beneficiaries and
internally displaced people.

In December 2022, the World Bank launched the
Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction and
Reform Trust Fund (URTF) for Ukraine's immediate
repairs and recovery efforts. The trust fund has received
contributions and pledges from Austria, Canada,
Iceland, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands,
Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland totaling $1.1 billion.
The URTF is a coordinated financing and support
mechanism to assist the Government of Ukraine in
sustaining its administrative and service delivery
capacity, conducting relief efforts, and planning
and implementing its recovery, reconstruction, and
reform agenda.

The World Bank has since established the Multi-Donor
Resources for Institutions and _ Infrastructure
(MRII) Facility to coordinate IBRD, IFC, and MIGA
efforts for Ukraine. The PEACE project and the
URTF now fall under the MRIlI Facility, as does IFC's
Economic Resilience Action (ERA) program and other
initiatives that allow donors to help Ukraine address

its immediate needs to sustain key public services, the
private sector, and wider recovery and reconstruction.
The MRII takes a phased and multi-pronged approach
to mobilizing financing and coordinating resources
through guarantees, co- and parallel financing, and
other financial instruments.

4.2 Easing the Impact of 
Forced Displacement 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused the fastest-
growing refugee crisis in Europe since the end of 
World War II. Globally, an estimated 108 million people 
have been forcibly displaced from their homes, either 
internally in their countries or externally as refugees.15 
Some of these displaced people face the prospect of 
never being able to return home. Given the protracted 
nature of forced displacement, the global community 
has combined humanitarian assistance with longer-
term development financing to help refugees become 
more self-reliant so that they can contribute more to 
their own futures and their host communities.
During the last five years, IBRD/IDA trust funds have 
disbursed $844 million to help countries address 
issues related to forced displacement (Figure 4.3). 
More than 90 percent of these resources went to five

Facility (GCFF) disbursed $9 million to Lebanon to 
address the protracted economic and social crises 
in the country and the Port of Beirut explosion 
in 2020, in addition to the influx of refugees from 
neighboring Syria.
RE disbursements for activities that address forced 
displacement peaked at 11 percent of total RE

partners’ activities toward formalizing the Syrian labor 
force and easing Syrians’ access to jobs. Under the 
Economic Opportunities for Jordanians and Syrian 
Refugees project, the number of work permits 
issued to Syrians increased from 45,000 in 2019 to 
62,000 in 2022 and currently stands at 77,000. Jordan 
was also the site for the Mashreq Gender Facility’s

pilot helped local municipalities understand and take 
regulatory action to address the gender barriers that 
displaced women face in the job market.
Another important focus area is education. Among 
the Syrian population in Lebanon, for example, 59 
percent of Syrian refugees ages 3–18 are not in 
formal schooling. The Lebanon Syrian Crisis Trust 
Fund (LSCTF) and the Results in Education for All 
Children Trust Fund (REACH) together provided 
$96 million in co-financing for a $100 million IDA 
project in Lebanon that has been instrumental 
in maintaining learning continuity despite the

Trust fund financing from AFI and the Global 
Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) 
Private Sector Window have helped Ethiopia advance 
its goal of establishing cooperative farming networks 
to foster economies of scale, higher quality products, 
and less fragmented supply chains. IFC advised 
Soufflet Malt Ethiopia, one of the leading investors in 
the malting sector, on expanding local sourcing. The 
project increased farmers’ access to improved seed 
varieties and established contract farming through 
aggregators and farmer financing models. By June 
2023, Soufflet’s annual purchase of grain from the 
local market was over 88,000 tons—more than double 
the project’s target—and the combined sales revenue 
of nearly 80,000 farmers increased to $87.5 million. 
Soufflet’s investment saves an estimated $50 million 
in imports per year for the country.

support from the Comprehensive Japan Trust Fund, 
the program has expanded local research and data 
with reports on the cost of bullying and harassment in 
Nigeria’s workplaces as well as gender gap analyses 
of the most capitalized companies on the Nigeria 
Exchange. The program has created a peer learning 
platform where 18 companies have made more than 
165 public commitments to implement solutions to 
reduce gender gaps in their businesses.
The World Bank also engages with the private sector in 
conflict-affected and fragile economies through MIGA, 
which provides coverage where other insurers are 
often not willing or unable to go. Three of MIGA’s five 
trust funds are focused on FCV settings, including the 
West Bank and Gaza Trust Fund. It was established 
in 1997 to encourage private sector investment and 
economic development in the West Bank and Gaza, 
by offering political risk insurance to both local and 
foreign investors. The West Bank and Gaza is not a 
member of the IMF, World Bank, or MIGA, so it is not 
eligible for their sources of financing. The trust fund 
is used to cover guarantees underwritten in the West 
Bank and Gaza for the full amount of the guarantee. 
The trust fund had an initial paid-up contribution of just 
over $15 million. As of April 30, 2023, its underwriting 
capacity was around $28 million, with the increase 
resulting from interest income, premiums, and returns 
on investments since its inception. It has supported 
the issuance of MIGA guarantees worth $45 million 
(gross) for 13 projects.
The Conflict-Affected and Fragile Economies 
Facility (CAFEF) was established in 2013 to support 
MIGA guarantees in the riskiest of FCV contexts.

a first and second loss layer of donor grants and 
a callable guarantee from donors.18 MIGA also

Private Sector Window have helped Ethiopia advance
its goal of establishing cooperative farming networks
to foster economies of scale, higher quality products,
and less fragmented supply chains. IFC advised
Soufflet Malt Ethiopia, one of the leading investors in
the malting sector, on expanding local sourcing. The
project increased farmers’ access to improved seed
varieties and established contract farming through
aggregators and farmer financing models. By June
2023, Soufflet’s annual purchase of grain from the
local market was over 88,000 tons—more than double
the project's target—and the combined sales revenue
of nearly 80,000 farmers increased to $875 million.
Soufflet's investment saves an estimated $50 million
in imports per year for the country.

In Nigeria, the IFC-managed multi-partner Facility
for Investment Climate Advisory Services (FIAS)”
funds the Upstream Special Economic Zone West
Africa project, which advises the country on adopting
and implementing legal, regulatory, and institutional
frameworks for a competitive special economic zone.
This will enable downstream private investments in
health care, aeronautics, manufacturing, agribusiness,
petrochemicals, and infrastructure while promoting
greater economic opportunity for women.

8 Under the CAFEF arrangements, when MIGA makes a call on the callable guarantee by providing notice of the amount
and claim payment date to the donor once MIGA has made a claim determination, the donor is required to pay the required
contribution to MIGA no later than 10 days prior to the claim payment date.

participates in the first loss layer alongside CAFEF 
to the extent determined by the agency. The initial 
loss layer provides protection from the initial losses 
occurring under MIGA’s Contract of Guarantee. Excess 
loss above the initial loss layer is borne completely 
by MIGA, and where applicable, its reinsurance 
partners. CAFEF’s success lies in the fact that it offers 
a high degree of leverage to its donors. As of April 30, 
2023, CAFEF had facilitated more than $1 billion in 
gross MIGA guarantee issuance, and its corpus was 
$68.7 million. 
In Ukraine, CAFEF supported MIGA in issuing a €100 
million capital optimization guarantee ($107 million) for 
one year and one day to Raiffeisen Bank International 
AG (RBI), a major banking and financial services 
group based in Austria. The guarantee covers equity 
investments in RBI’s subsidiary, Raiffeisen Bank Joint 
Stock Company (RBUA) in Ukraine, against the risk of 
expropriation of funds with respect to the mandatory 
cash reserves held at Ukraine’s central bank (NBU). 
Local banking regulations mandate that RBUA 
maintain reserves with NBU to be able to conduct 
operations in Ukraine. MIGA’s capital optimization 
guarantee reduces the risk weight applicable to those 
mandatory reserves at the RBI group level to zero, 
freeing up funds that RBUA can use to expand local 
lending to individuals, small businesses, and corporate 
clients in critical industries and increase the volume 
of essential non-credit banking operations. Additional 
RBUA lending enabled by the MIGA guarantee will 
bolster employment and stimulate economic activity.  
Given the heightened risks of operating in Ukraine, MIGA 
created the Support for Ukraine’s Reconstruction 
and Economy Trust Fund (SURE TF). Established 
in March 2023 with Japan’s anchor contribution of 
$23 million (expected to grow to $300 million through 
contributions from additional donors), SURE TF will 
be used as a first-loss layer or toward reinsurance 
for MIGA’s guarantees in the country. MIGA blends 
donor financing from the SURE TF with risk exposure 
on its own books and crowds in public and private 
reinsurance where available to issue guarantees in 
support of Ukraine.

The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine have collided to upend the fiscal and trade 
balances of many developing countries, undermining 
their financial stability and long-term growth 
prospects. The Financial Stability Board affirms that 
the current economic environment of high inflation, 
lower growth, and much tighter global financial 
conditions is particularly challenging for financial 
stability. The limited policy space in many jurisdictions 
makes it more difficult for authorities to intervene 
should a shock materialize.19
The forces that have powered growth and prosperity 
since the early 1990s have weakened, resulting in a 
persistent and broad-based decline in long-term 
growth prospects.20 Productivity, trade, labor force, 
and investment growth are expected to flag over the 
remainder of this decade. The World Bank’s latest 
projections indicate that the world economy will remain 
frail—and at risk of a deeper downturn—into 2024.21 
This unstable economic footing imperils the ability 
of emerging markets and developing economies to 
create jobs and deliver essential services, and it puts 
development goals further out of reach. 
The World Bank has long regarded strengthening the 
international financial architecture and enhancing 
developing countries' participation in the global 
trading system as global public priorities requiring 
global collective action.22 Today, the Bank’s support for 
financial sustainability and resilience has broadened 
beyond strengthening countries financial systems 
and macro-economic stability to include financial 
inclusion, access to finance, building effective 
and accountable institutions to tackle corruption, 
strengthening tax revenue generation and debt 
management, and improving financial resilience in 
response to natural disasters. 
Trust funds and FIFs support this effort, especially 
through advisory services, analytics, and other 
knowledge-based activities that build institutional 
and human resource capacity to effectively manage 
instability. They contribute to projects that increase 
access to finance, promote free and fair trade, and 
help developing countries join and compete in the 
digital economy.
5.1 Increasing Access 
to Finance 
Across developing countries, 131 million micro, 
small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) have 
unmet financing needs estimated at approximately 
$5 trillion.23 In the financial services sector, women are 
disproportionately disadvantaged. While 76 percent of 
adults worldwide have a bank account, close to one-
third of adults—1.4 billion—still do not have one, and 
54 percent of all unbanked adults are women.24 The 
COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted MSMEs as 
well as financial service providers serving the base of 
the pyramid, including microfinance institutions, non-
bank financial institutions, and MSME-focused banks. 
With the support of trust funds, the World Bank seeks 
to expand access to financial products and services 
to those who have historically been excluded from the 
banking system, particularly in IDA countries, including 
micro-borrowers, SMEs, women, home buyers, and 
farmers, among others.

For example, in Georgia, the EU2020 Knowledge

implementation of a $103 million IBRD project that has 
strengthened the enabling environment for MSMEs to 
access finance post-pandemic. Policy dialogue and 
analytical reports prepared with trust fund financing 
paved the way for several important reforms, including 
the adoption of the new Law on Investment Funds 
and amendments to the Law on the Securities Market 
and the Law on Payment Systems and Payment

fintechs, financial infrastructure, and insurance, and 
strengthened a partial credit guarantee program, 
which aims to address high collateral requirements 
and risk aversion of financial institutions to unlock 
financial intermediation to SMEs.
To facilitate access to finance for agri-MSMEs and 
small farmers in Central Europe, Austrian funding 
through FIAS supported IFC’s Central Europe 
Agriculture Finance Digital Platform in developing a 
digital gateway to address information asymmetry 
between lenders and small farmers. It consolidates 
finance, climate, pricing, and other information based 
on digital data. It also provides non-financial services 
and training on climate-smart solutions for farmers 
and agri-MSMEs.
Ukrainian refugees also have financial needs, but 
without proof of Ukrainian bank records or credit 
histories, they struggle to open bank accounts or obtain 
credit in host countries. Drawing on the partnerships 
and experiences of the Ukraine Financial Inclusion 
Credit Reporting project funded by donors,25 IFC 
launched the Digital Data Corridors initiative in 2022. 
The initiative uses existing Ukrainian and European 
credit information infrastructure and brings together 
credit information providers, financial institutions, and 
industry experts to allow financial institutions to receive 
international credit histories, identity verification, and 
bank transaction data electronically in real time. By 
the end of 2022, credit bureaus in the largest host 
countries for Ukrainians, including Poland, Czechia, 
and Moldova, were linked to the corridor, facilitating 
access to finance for Ukrainian refugees. 
This pioneering initiative will 
allow Ukrainian citizens to show 
the positive credit history they 
earned back home and build trust 
with a future employer and access 
finance from Moldovan banks and 
other financial institutions.

The challenge of accessing finance also extends to 
municipalities in Kazakhstan. Urban infrastructure 
is seen as a potential source of private investment 
to help expand basic services, but major regulatory 
obstacles to non-sovereign borrowing and public-
private partnerships put Kazakhstan’s cities at a

support MIGA’s clients in its strategic focus, including 
climate, gender, fragility, and other vital areas, such 
as environmental and social standards and corporate 
governance. Through FAS, MIGA is able to address 
specific challenges for projects across all sectors, 
including agriculture, manufacturing, telecom, and 
infrastructure, to achieve sustained development 
outcomes. FAS is intended to complement MIGA’s 
existing capacity and make its product offerings more

The Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative 
(We-Fi) FIF hosted by the World Bank, works to 
break down barriers related to finance, market access, 
and capacity to empower women entrepreneurs in 
the developing world. In Bangladesh, for example, 
many women-led businesses have faced significant 
disruptions in supply and demand due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. With support from We-Fi, the World Bank 
implements the Corporate Connect Program jointly 
with local and international partners. The program 
educates and engages larger corporations to stimulate 
corporate sourcing from women-owned businesses in 
Bangladesh, and it champions regulatory reforms to 
sustain these market linkages. 
Funding from We-Fi and FIAS also contributes to an 
IFC project in Colombia that has helped Bancamia, 
the second-largest microfinance institution in the 
country, develop and pilot a plan to increase access 
to finance and banking services to forcibly displaced 
people from Venezuela, particularly women. As of 
June 2022, over 6,300 migrants and returnees have 
opened savings accounts or started lines of credit. 
The project’s success reflects the strong demand for 
access to finance among forcibly displaced people, 
and offers a model for replication in other refugee-
hosting countries.

5.2 Boosting International 
Trade and Integration
International trade is a powerful driver of economic 
development, 
poverty 
reduction, 
and 
financial 
sustainability. Despite these benefits, critics blame 
globalization for losing manufacturing jobs in 
advanced economies, environmental degradation, and 
disruptions to supplies of vital goods, like vaccines. 
Increasing 
geopolitical 
tensions 
prompt 
major 
players to raise barriers to trade and investment and 
to subsidize domestic production of goods deemed 
strategic. The World Bank estimates that a slump in 
investor confidence could push 30–50 million people 
into poverty by 2030, depending on the severity of 
protectionist policies put in place by advanced and 
developing economies.27
Despite these trends, World Bank trust funds continue 
to help countries and communities participate in 
regional and global trading systems. For example, the 
Horn of Africa Umbrella supported the development 
of the East Africa Trade Facilitation Roadmap and its 
adoption by the Finance Ministers of Kenya, Ethiopia, 
Somalia, Djibouti, and South Sudan. The roadmap 
plots a course for coordinated public policy responses 
to development challenges that hamper economic 
growth in the region, and it underpins the Bank’s $325 
million East Africa Regional Trade Facilitation Project 
now under preparation.
Also in East Africa, the Umbrella Facility for Trade 
(UFT) provided technical assistance and capacity 
strengthening to the Government of Kenya to negotiate 
and assess the impacts of new trade agreements 
and changes in regional integration initiatives. This 
included re-negotiating the East African Community’s 
common external tariff, analyzing the economic and 
distributional effects of the African Continental Free 
Trade Area, and assessing the impacts of a free-
trade agreement with the United States. More than

5.2 Boosting International
Trade and Integration

International trade is a powerful driver of economic
development, poverty reduction, and _ financial
sustainability. Despite these benefits, critics blame
globalization for losing manufacturing jobs in
advanced economies, environmental degradation, and
disruptions to supplies of vital goods, like vaccines.
Increasing geopolitical tensions prompt major
players to raise barriers to trade and investment and
to subsidize domestic production of goods deemed
strategic. The World Bank estimates that a slump in
investor confidence could push 30-50 million people
into poverty by 2030, depending on the severity of
protectionist policies put in place by advanced and
developing economies.’

Despite these trends, World Bank trust funds continue
to help countries and communities participate in
regional and global trading systems. For example, the
Horn of Africa Umbrella supported the development
of the East Africa Trade Facilitation Roadmap and its
adoption by the Finance Ministers of Kenya, Ethiopia,
Somalia, Djibouti, and South Sudan. The roadmap
plots a course for coordinated public policy responses
to development challenges that hamper economic
growth in the region, and it underpins the Bank's $325
million East Africa Regional Trade Facilitation Project
now under preparation.

Also in East Africa, the Umbrella Facility for Trade
(UFT) provided technical assistance and capacity
strengthening to the Government of Kenya to negotiate
and assess the impacts of new trade agreements
and changes in regional integration initiatives. This
included re-negotiating the East African Community’s
common external tariff, analyzing the economic and

distributional effects of the African Continental Free
Trade Area, and assessing the impacts of a free-
trade agreement with the United States. More than
70 government staff members received training on
modern trade agreement negotiations.

Our negotiation teams have

been able to draft policies that
are so well written that, in our
first meeting with the U.S. Trade
Representative...they tipped their
hats to us.

Trust funds also help build the evidence base to 
solve issues related to remittances, which are vital 
for the global economy and millions of households 
worldwide. Remittance inflows to low and middle-
income economies reached $626 billion in 2022,28 
exceeding foreign direct investment and official 
development assistance. However, remittances often 
come at a high transaction cost for migrants and their 
families. With backing from the Financial Inclusion 
Trust Fund (FINC) and the Payment Systems and 
Remittances Trust Fund (PYMT), the World Bank's 
Remittance Prices Worldwide (RPW) database has 
collected quarterly data on remittance costs since 
2009, covering 367 remittance corridors. The RPW 
serves as the official reference for global remittance 
service cost reduction objectives and is used to track 
progress toward SDGs on remittance costs and to 
inform policy decisions.

As governments and the private sector contend with 
the rising costs of finance, growing debt burdens, 
and increasing inflation, it becomes even more 
important to develop strong, well-regulated local 
capital markets that can promote more resilient and 
sustainable growth. Yet most developing countries 
lack the necessary preconditions for a healthy capital 
market: stable macroeconomic fundamentals, a sound 
banking system, a good institutional and regulatory 
framework, an efficient market infrastructure, and 
sufficient market size. In 2018, the World Bank and 
development partners launched the Joint Capital 
Markets Program (J-CAP) to bring together 
experts from across the Bank to deliver advisory 
services sequenced with investments to support the 
development of local debt and equity capital markets. 
J-CAP launched in 14 countries, including the West 
African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).

In West Africa, the program has focused on 
harmonizing the capital market environment across 
the eight WAEMU countries to expand the domestic 
institutional investor base and develop capital market 
instruments to increase real sector development. 
An improved regulatory framework, issued by the 
regional capital markets authority in January 2022 
with key assistance from J-CAP, enabled the creation 
of local private equity and venture capital funds, 
requiring them to direct at least 70 percent of their 
total investment portfolio to SMEs unlisted on stock 
markets. This will help channel investment capital to 
promising startups and young enterprises that are 
typically too risky for banks. 
5.3 Establishing Regional 
Catastrophe Risk Pools
Climate change and increasingly extreme weather 
events exacerbate the frequency and intensity of 
natural disasters, which have surged over the past 
50 years.29 According to the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO), extreme weather and climate 
and water-related events caused nearly 12,000 
reported disasters between 1970 and 2021, with 
over 2 million deaths and $4.3 trillion in economic 
losses.30 The World Bank is a leader in establishing 
and managing designated facilities and trust funds to 
help countries respond to and recover from natural 
disasters. Regional risk insurance pools are a cost-
efficient means of enhancing countries’ financial 
sustainability and resilience, by providing short-term 
liquidity when an insurance policy is triggered by a 
catastrophic event. 
For example, the Global Shield Financing Facility 
(GSFF), formerly the Global Risk Financing Facility, 
helps to strengthen the financial resilience of 
pastoralists in the Horn of Africa—one of the poorest 
and most fragile regions in the world, with 50 million 
pastoralists among the most vulnerable. When 
drought hits, livestock either die or are sold at rock-
bottom prices. With support from the GSFF, Djibouti, 
Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia have come together to 
pool their drought risk through a regional institution, 
ZEP-RE, and transfer it to the insurance market. By 
March 2023, 159,000 pastoralists (about 1 million 
with dependents) were enrolled in the program 
with a package of drought index insurance, savings, 
digital accounts, and financial literacy. Over half of 
participants (57 percent) are women. The initiative 
also partners with the Consultative Group to Assist 
the Poor (CGAP) to ensure that the savings and 
insurance products meet the needs of women herders 
and service providers are incentivized to deliver.
Our cattle are like our bank 
account. When our livestock is 
affected by drought, it is like 
we have lost that account and 
we are hopeless. Since I joined 
the program and received the 
training, I can now afford to buy 
fodder for my animals.

Countries in Central America and the Caribbean 
are also vulnerable to natural disasters, leading to 
human and economic losses that hinder economic 
growth. The COVID-19 pandemic and global inflation

entity designed to provide disaster and climate-
related insurance to Pacific Island countries and build 
capacity in both the public and private sectors while 
helping to minimize the costs of premiums to support 
the development of disaster risk insurance markets. 
Before the PCRIC’s closure in fiscal 2023, it made full 
insurance payouts within 30 days of the occurrence of 
insured events, and the claims-paying capacity was 
enough to sustain a 1-in-200-year insured loss.

This chapter provides aggregate financial information on the activities of trust funds and FIFs administered individually 
or jointly by IBRD, IFC, MIGA, and ICSID. It looks at five-year trends, from fiscal 2019–23, on trust fund and FIF 
inflows, outflows, and assets under management (Box 6.1)—all of which demonstrate the World Bank's position as 
the partner of choice to advance development agendas in countries, regions, and around the globe. Due to rounding, 
disbursements below $50 million are displayed as $0.00 million and other figures presented in this chapter may not 
add up to totals. 
Definitions of Key Financial Terms
Inflows are cash contributions to trust funds and FIFs, including encashment of 
promissory notes and cash receipts from donors. 
All contributions (cash and promissory notes, net of certain discounts) are reported 
using the historical FX rates at the date of receipt. Amounts to donor balance and 
holding accounts have been excluded. From fiscal 2017 onward, most contributors 
to the Global Fund provide contributions directly to its secretariat, and the trustee 
receives these funds as contributions from the Global Fund Secretariat as a contributor. 
Outflows are disbursements from trust funds and cash transfers from FIFs to 
implementing entities (World Bank excluded) for development activities. For 
accounting purposes, FIF transfers to the World Bank as an implementing entity are 
not included in FIF disbursements; instead, they are transferred and later recorded as 
IBRD/IDA trust fund disbursements.
Assets are funds held in trust (FHIT)—cash, investments, promissory notes—and 
contributions receivable at the end of the fiscal year. “Other” FHIT includes amounts 
held in escrow on behalf of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment 
Dispute (ICSID), donor balance accounts (DBA), balances on administration accounts, 
and unapplied receipts.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT 
The World Bank manages the liquid assets of trust funds and FIFs in a single, commingled investment pool that 
provides the following benefits to its participants: 
• A selection of sub-portfolios or model portfolios to accommodate varying liquidity needs and risk 
preferences of different funds managed within a comprehensive risk management framework
• Access to a wide variety of investment products and longer terms of maturity to enhance investment returns 
over time
• Regular review of liquidity needs across funds to optimize investments over the longer term
• Standard and customized environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment solutions and product 
offerings to cater to various sustainable responsible investing (SRI) aspirations of individual funds
These investments earn income based on the trust fund’s share of interest income, realized gains or losses from 
the sale of securities, and unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the asset value held by the pool at 
fair value.

ASSET MIX OF TRUST FUNDS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 
Upon receipt of development partner contributions to a trust fund, the World Bank invests these resources in the 
international capital markets until they are disbursed to final recipients. Trust fund assets are managed with the 
primary investment objective of capital preservation and liquidity on demand. 
The provisions of the World Bank’s General Investment Authorizations for IBRD and IDA also apply to the 
investment of trust fund assets. Accordingly, these assets are managed within conservative overall risk tolerance 
parameters and invested in high-quality securities, which include securities issued by sovereign governments, 
government agencies, and multilateral and other official institutions, asset-backed and agency-guaranteed 
mortgage-backed securities, as well as swaps and a range of derivatives in support of securities investments. 
Subject to the primary investment objective, the asset mix among the investment products authorized by the 
General Investment Authorizations is based on market opportunities available within the applicable risk limits. As 
part of monitoring and financial and risk management oversight, a regular rebalancing of assets is performed to 
ensure that enough liquidity is available to meet disbursement needs.
The Investment Management of World Bank Trust Fund offers more details about how the World Bank manages 
and invests development partner financial resources.
The portfolio asset allocation as of end of fiscal 2023 reflects a conservative investment 
approach and defensive positioning to maintain the portfolio within the policy risk tolerance. 
The portfolio includes a large allocation of 27 percent in cash and money market instruments, 
followed by 23 percent invested in sovereign government bonds, 14 percent in agencies 
bonds, and 13 percent in covered bonds. The rest of the portfolio is invested in sovereign 
guaranteed, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and a small allocation to equities.

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS
Keeping pace with the rapid shift in the global asset management industry toward sustainable and responsible 
investing (SRI), the World Bank is committed to integrating sustainability-related themes in all operational activities, 
including the investment management function entrusted to it by its clients. 
Since July 2019, the Bank Treasury has applied ESG integration as the default SRI approach to the trust fund 
pooled assets under management within the purview of the IBRD/IDA General Investment Authorizations and 
clients’ investment guidelines as stipulated in the Investment Management Agreements. ESG integration is an 
extension of traditional financial analysis that explicitly considers ESG factors in investments.
Further, in response to growing demand from some FIFs for more mission-driven thematic SRI investment 
strategies with sustainable development impacts, the World Bank rolled out the Sustainable Bond Strategy in 
fiscal 2021. It followed a gradual and phased approach, starting with the Sovereign, Supranational, and Agency 
(SSA) universe permissible under the existing Investment Authorizations. As of June 30, 2023, the market value of 
the portfolio invested in the strategy was $440 million, with 94 percent of the portfolio invested in 32 impact bonds 
issued by 21 SSA issuers. The Bank published its first Sustainable Fixed-Income Strategy Impact Report in 2023 to 
highlight specific issuers and holdings, SDG-aligned impact metrics, and project stories (Figure 6.14).
Through a tiered offering of SRI investment approaches, the World Bank, as the trustee for trust funds and FIFs, 
intends to achieve the overarching objective of capital preservation and liquidity on demand. The World Bank 
will continue to explore additional SRI strategies in line with current market practices to meet the evolving SRI 
aspirations and development objectives of development partners.
