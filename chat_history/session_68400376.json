This initiative provided $7.4 billion to finance 103 projects that offered liquidity, working capital, and trade financing to keep companies operational during the pandemic. The facility especially targeted industries most affected by COVID-19, helping to preserve jobs and stabilize private sector employment in fragile and conflict-affected situations.\n\n- Region: Global (including fragile and conflict-affected areas)\n- Sector: Private Sector / Job Creation\n- Donor/Fund: IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility\n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 94\n\n**Example 2: World Bank Emergency Cash Transfers to Support Vulnerable Workers**\n\nIn Bangladesh, the Human Capital Umbrella Program funded by the MDTF helped integrate economic inclusion components into major cash transfer programs. This support aimed to assist low-income wage earners in gaining a better foothold in the workplace post-pandemic, thereby supporting private sector job retention and creation. Similarly, in Colombia, grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) was used to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees, helping to mitigate COVID-19 impacts and ease tensions with host communities, indirectly supporting private sector stability and job opportunities.\n\n- Region: Bangladesh and Colombia\n- Sector: Social Protection / Private Sector Job Support\n- Donor/Fund: Human Capital Umbrella Program; State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF)\n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 94"
