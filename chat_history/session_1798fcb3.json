This initiative provided $7.4 billion financing across 103 projects, offering liquidity, working capital, and trade financing. The facility prioritized industries most affected by COVID-19, helping companies stay operational and retain employees. Additionally, a Base of the Pyramid Program was launched with $400 million (increased by $200 million in 2022) to support the poorest and hardest-hit populations. This comprehensive financial support helped mitigate job losses and sustain economic activity in fragile and conflict-affected situations.\n\n- **Region:** Global, including Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations (FCS)  \n- **Sector:** Private Sector, with focus on industries affected by COVID-19  \n- **Donor/Fund:** IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- **Source Document and Page:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 44\u201345  \n\n---\n\n**Example 2: Survey and Financing Support for Somali Enterprises**\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn 2020, the MDTF supported a survey to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on Somali enterprises, which informed policy responses to aid private sector recovery. The survey findings directly contributed to scaling up an apex MSME financing facility supported by a World Bank lending operation. This facility improved access to finance for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and larger firms, addressing liquidity shortages caused by the pandemic. The additional financing helped vulnerable but viable firms maintain operations and jobs, demonstrating targeted support to sustain employment in a fragile context.\n\n- **Region:** Somalia  \n- **Sector:** Private Sector, MSMEs  \n- **Donor/Fund:** World Bank Trust Fund (MDTF)  \n- **Source Document and Page:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 45"
