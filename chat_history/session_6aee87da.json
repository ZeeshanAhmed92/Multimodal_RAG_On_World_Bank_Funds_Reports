This initiative provided $7.4 billion financing across 103 projects, offering liquidity, working capital, and trade financing. The facility particularly targeted industries hardest hit by COVID-19, helping companies stay operational and preserve jobs. Additionally, the Base of the Pyramid Program was launched with $400 million to support the poorest populations and those most impacted by the pandemic, receiving an additional $200 million in 2022. This program helped sustain employment opportunities in fragile and conflict-affected areas by maintaining business continuity.\n\n**Metadata:**  \n- Region: Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations (Global)  \n- Sector: Private Sector / Job Creation  \n- Donor/Fund: IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 44-45  \n\n---\n\n### Example 2: Emergency Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Migrants and Refugees in Colombia\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe World Bank used grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) in 2020 to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees in Colombia. This intervention aimed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and ease tensions with host communities. By supporting vulnerable populations economically, the program helped stabilize livelihoods and indirectly supported private sector job retention and creation in local markets. This approach contributed to social cohesion and economic inclusion in a fragile context, fostering conditions conducive to job creation.\n\n**Metadata:**  \n- Region: Colombia  \n- Sector: Social Protection / Economic Inclusion  \n- Donor/Fund: State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF)  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 44-45"
