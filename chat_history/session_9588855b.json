The facility provided $7.4 billion to finance 103 projects offering liquidity, working capital, and trade financing. This support was crucial in keeping companies operational, especially in industries hardest hit by COVID-19, thereby preserving jobs and stabilizing employment in fragile and conflict-affected areas. Additionally, the Base of the Pyramid Program under this facility targeted the poorest populations and those most impacted by the pandemic, with an initial $400 million launched in 2021 and an additional $200 million in 2022.\n\n**Metadata:**  \n- Region: Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations (FCS) globally  \n- Sector: Private Sector / Job Creation  \n- Donor/Fund: IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94\n\n---\n\n### Example 2: Emergency Cash Transfers and Economic Inclusion in Bangladesh and Colombia\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe MDTF supported early COVID-19 response activities to protect vulnerable populations and sustain jobs. In Bangladesh, funding from the Human Capital Umbrella Program enabled the addition of economic inclusion components to major cash transfer programs, helping low-income wage earners regain workplace footholds post-pandemic. In Colombia, the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) financed emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees, mitigating COVID-19 spread and easing tensions with host communities. These interventions helped stabilize livelihoods and supported private sector job retention in fragile contexts.\n\n**Metadata:**  \n- Region: Bangladesh and Colombia  \n- Sector: Social Protection and Private Sector Job Support  \n- Donor/Fund: Human Capital Umbrella Program; State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF)  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94"
