    "content": "### Example 1: IFC\u2019s Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility Supports Private Sector Liquidity\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn 2020, IFC launched the Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility, which expanded to $8.6 billion to support private sector companies affected by the pandemic. This initiative provided $7.4 billion to finance 103 projects aimed at maintaining liquidity, working capital, and trade financing. The facility particularly targeted industries hardest hit by COVID-19, helping companies stay in business and preserve jobs. Additionally, the Base of the Pyramid Program was launched with $400 million to support the poorest populations and those most impacted by the crisis, receiving an extra $200 million in 2022. This program helped sustain private sector employment in fragile and conflict-affected situations by ensuring continued business operations during the pandemic.\n\n**Metadata:**  \n- Region: Global (including fragile and conflict-affected situations)  \n- Sector: Private Sector / Job Creation  \n- Donor/Fund: IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94\n\n---\n\n### Example 2: Emergency Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Migrants in Colombia\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn Colombia, the World Bank used grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees during the COVID-19 pandemic. This intervention helped mitigate the spread of the virus and eased social tensions between migrants and host communities. By supporting vulnerable populations financially, the program helped maintain economic stability and job opportunities within the private sector, particularly in fragile contexts where displacement and conflict impact labor markets. This approach contributed to preserving livelihoods and promoting social cohesion in a fragile setting.\n\n**Metadata:**  \n- Region: Colombia  \n- Sector: Social Protection / Job Creation  \n- Donor/Fund: State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF)  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94"
