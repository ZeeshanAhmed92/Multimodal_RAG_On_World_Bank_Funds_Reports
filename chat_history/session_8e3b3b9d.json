This initiative provided $7.4 billion to finance 103 projects, offering liquidity, working capital, and trade financing. The facility especially targeted industries hardest hit by COVID-19, helping companies stay in business and retain jobs. Additionally, the Base of the Pyramid Program was launched with $400 million to support the poorest populations and those most impacted by the crisis, receiving an extra $200 million in 2022. This comprehensive financial support helped sustain employment and stabilize private sector operations during a critical period.\n\n- **Region:** Global  \n- **Sector:** Private Sector / COVID-19 Response  \n- **Donor/Fund:** IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- **Source Document and Page:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 44-45  \n\n---\n\n**Example 2: World Bank Emergency Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Migrants and Refugees in Colombia**\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn 2020, the World Bank utilized grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees in Colombia. This intervention aimed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and ease social tensions with host communities. By supporting these vulnerable populations, the program helped maintain social stability and economic inclusion, indirectly supporting private sector job creation by preserving community cohesion and enabling migrants and refugees to participate in local economies. This approach exemplified how targeted social protection measures can contribute to private sector resilience and job retention in fragile contexts.\n\n- **Region:** Colombia  \n- **Sector:** Social Protection / Private Sector Inclusion  \n- **Donor/Fund:** State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF)  \n- **Source Document and Page:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 44-45"
