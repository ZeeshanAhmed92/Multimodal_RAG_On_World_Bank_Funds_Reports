The facility provided $7.4 billion to finance 103 projects offering liquidity, working capital, and trade financing. This support was critical to keeping companies operational, especially in industries hardest hit by COVID-19, thereby preserving jobs and stabilizing employment in fragile and conflict-affected situations.\n\n**Metadata:**  \n- Region: Global, including Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations (FCS)  \n- Sector: Private Sector / Job Creation  \n- Donor/Fund: IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94  \n\n---\n\n### Example 2: World Bank Emergency Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Migrants and Refugees in Colombia\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn 2020, the World Bank used grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees in Colombia. This intervention helped mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and eased tensions with host communities. By stabilizing vulnerable populations economically, the program contributed to maintaining social cohesion and supporting informal job markets, which are vital for private sector job creation in fragile contexts.\n\n**Metadata:**  \n- Region: Colombia  \n- Sector: Social Protection / Private Sector Employment Support  \n- Donor/Fund: State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF)  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94"
