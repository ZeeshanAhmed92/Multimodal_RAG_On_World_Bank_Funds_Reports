The facility provided $7.4 billion to finance 103 projects that offered liquidity, working capital, and trade financing. This support was particularly targeted at industries hardest hit by COVID-19, helping companies stay in business and preserve jobs. Additionally, the Base of the Pyramid Program was launched with $400 million (increased by $200 million in 2022) to support the poorest populations and those most impacted economically by the pandemic. This initiative contributed significantly to job retention and creation in fragile and conflict-affected situations.\n\n**Metadata:**  \n- Region: Global (including fragile and conflict-affected situations)  \n- Sector: Private Sector Development  \n- Donor/Fund: IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 44-45  \n\n---\n\n### Example 2: State and Peacebuilding Fund Emergency Cash Transfers in Colombia\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn Colombia, the World Bank used grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees during the COVID-19 pandemic. This intervention helped mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and eased tensions between refugees and host communities. By stabilizing vulnerable populations economically, the program contributed to maintaining social cohesion and supporting livelihoods, indirectly fostering private sector job creation and economic inclusion in a fragile context.\n\n**Metadata:**  \n- Region: Colombia  \n- Sector: Social Protection and Economic Inclusion  \n- Donor/Fund: State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF)  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 45"
