The facility provided $7.4 billion to finance 103 projects that offered liquidity, working capital, and trade financing. This support helped keep companies in business, particularly in industries hardest hit by COVID-19, thereby protecting jobs and stabilizing employment in fragile and conflict-affected situations. The initiative also included a Base of the Pyramid Program launched in 2021 with $400 million, later increased by $200 million in 2022, targeting the poorest populations most impacted by the crisis.  \n- **Region:** Global, including fragile and conflict-affected areas  \n- **Sector:** Private Sector / Job Creation  \n- **Donor/Fund:** IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- **Source:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94  \n\n### Example 2: Emergency Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Migrants in Colombia  \nThe World Bank used grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) in 2020 to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees in Colombia. This intervention helped mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and eased tensions with host communities, indirectly supporting economic stability and job retention in the private sector by protecting vulnerable populations who participate in local labor markets. This approach helped maintain social cohesion and economic activity in fragile contexts, which is critical for job creation and private sector growth.  \n- **Region:** Colombia  \n- **Sector:** Social Protection / Private Sector Job Stability  \n- **Donor/Fund:** State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF)  \n- **Source:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94"
