    "content": "The SPF Umbrella Trust Fund Grants are financial grants approved to support various development objectives related to social protection, forced displacement, social cohesion, gender issues, climate action, and fragile contexts. These grants aim to address complex challenges in fragile, conflict-affected, and vulnerable (FCV) settings by funding projects that analyze, adapt, and enhance systems and policies to improve social outcomes.\n\nFor example, some grants focus on analyzing social protection systems in the Great Lakes Region of Africa to improve responses to internal displacement, while others test innovative approaches to strengthen social cohesion in West Africa. There are also global grants that develop frameworks for gender and forced displacement in urban settings and produce flagship studies on the peace and social dividends of climate action.\n\nThese grants are regionally and thematically diverse, supporting targeted interventions to promote peace, social cohesion, and resilience in vulnerable communities.\n\n**Metadata:**\n- Region: Global and various regions including Africa (Great Lakes, West Africa)\n- Sector: Social Protection, Forced Displacement, Social Cohesion, Gender, Climate Action\n- Donor/Fund: SPF Umbrella Trust Fund\n- Source Documents: SPF Umbrella Trust Fund Grants 2024, pages 2, 5, 7, 12, 15"
