This initiative provided $7.4 billion financing for 103 projects aimed at maintaining liquidity, working capital, and trade financing to keep companies operational, especially those hardest hit by the pandemic. The facility included a Base of the Pyramid Program launched with $400 million in 2021 (and an additional $200 million in 2022) to support the poorest populations and those most affected by COVID-19. This support helped preserve jobs and stabilize the private sector in fragile and conflict-affected situations during the crisis.\n\n- Region: Global (including fragile and conflict-affected situations)\n- Sector: Private Sector / Job Creation\n- Donor/Fund: IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility\n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94\n\n**Example 2: World Bank Emergency Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Groups**\n\nThe World Bank, using grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF), provided emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees in Colombia in 2020. This intervention helped mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and eased tensions with host communities, indirectly supporting private sector job creation by stabilizing vulnerable populations and maintaining social cohesion necessary for economic activity. Similarly, in Bangladesh, funding from the Human Capital Umbrella Program added economic-inclusion components to cash transfer programs, helping low-income wage earners gain a better foothold in the workplace post-pandemic.\n\n- Region: Colombia and Bangladesh\n- Sector: Social Protection / Private Sector Job Support\n- Donor/Fund: State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF), Human Capital Umbrella Program\n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94"
