The text mentions various studies, surveys, and initiatives related to fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCV), COVID-19 impacts, and private sector recovery, but does not detail MDTF's direct support examples for private sector job creation in 2020.\n\nIf you have more specific documents or pages, please share them, and I can look again."
