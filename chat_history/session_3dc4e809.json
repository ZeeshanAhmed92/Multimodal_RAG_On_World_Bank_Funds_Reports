This initiative provided $7.4 billion to finance 103 projects aimed at maintaining liquidity, working capital, and trade financing for companies severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The facility particularly targeted industries most affected by the crisis, helping to keep businesses operational and preserve jobs. Additionally, the Base of the Pyramid Program under this facility offered extra support to the poorest populations and those hardest hit by the pandemic, initially launching with $400 million in 2021 and receiving an additional $200 million in 2022. This program contributed to sustaining employment and economic stability in fragile contexts.\n\n- **Region:** Global (including fragile and conflict-affected situations)  \n- **Sector:** Private Sector / Job Creation  \n- **Donor/Fund:** IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- **Source Document and Page:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 44-45\n\n---\n\n**Example 2: World Bank Emergency Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Migrants and Refugees**\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn 2020, the World Bank utilized grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees in Colombia. This intervention aimed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and ease social tensions between migrants and host communities. By supporting vulnerable populations with cash transfers, the initiative helped stabilize livelihoods and indirectly supported job retention and creation in affected communities. This approach demonstrated how targeted social protection measures can contribute to private sector resilience and employment in fragile contexts.\n\n- **Region:** Colombia  \n- **Sector:** Social Protection / Private Sector Job Support  \n- **Donor/Fund:** State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF)  \n- **Source Document and Page:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 45"
