The facility provided $7.4 billion to finance 103 projects that offered liquidity, working capital, and trade financing to keep companies operational, especially in industries most affected by COVID-19. This initiative included a Base of the Pyramid Program aimed at supporting the poorest and hardest-hit populations, initially launched with $400 million and later receiving an additional $200 million in 2022. By maintaining business operations, the facility helped preserve jobs and stabilize economic activity in fragile and conflict-affected areas. This approach demonstrated how targeted financial support can sustain employment during crises.\n\n- **Region:** Global (including fragile and conflict-affected areas)  \n- **Sector:** Private Sector / Job Creation  \n- **Donor/Fund:** IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- **Source Document and Page:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 44-45  \n\n---\n\n**Example 2: World Bank Emergency Cash Transfers to Support Vulnerable Workers**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe MDTF supported private sector job creation indirectly by funding emergency cash transfer programs in countries like Bangladesh and Colombia during 2020. In Bangladesh, the Human Capital Umbrella Program helped integrate economic inclusion components into major cash transfer schemes, enabling low-income wage earners to better secure employment post-pandemic. In Colombia, grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) provided emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees, mitigating COVID-19 spread and easing social tensions with host communities. These interventions helped stabilize vulnerable populations\u2019 livelihoods, supporting their continued participation in local labor markets and private sector activities.\n\n- **Region:** Bangladesh and Colombia  \n- **Sector:** Social Protection / Private Sector Employment Support  \n- **Donor/Fund:** Human Capital Umbrella Program; State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF)  \n- **Source Document and Page:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 44-45"
