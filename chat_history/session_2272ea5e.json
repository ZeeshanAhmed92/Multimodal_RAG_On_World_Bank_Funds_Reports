    "content": "Here are two examples of how the MDTF supported private sector job creation in 2020 based on the provided context:\n\n1. **COVID-19 Impact Monitoring and MSME Financing in Somalia**\n   - The MDTF supported a survey to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Somali enterprises. The findings from this survey directly informed the scale-up of an apex MSME financing facility backed by a World Bank lending operation. This facility improved access to finance for MSMEs and larger firms, helping to mitigate pandemic-related liquidity shortages in vulnerable but viable businesses. This support helped sustain private sector jobs by enabling firms to continue operations during the crisis.\n   - **Region:** Somalia  \n   - **Sector:** Private Sector / MSMEs  \n   - **Donor/Fund:** MDTF (World Bank Trust Fund)  \n   - **Source:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 45\n\n2. **IFC\u2019s Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility**\n   - Launched in 2020, IFC\u2019s Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility reached $8.6 billion, providing liquidity, working capital, and trade financing to keep companies in business, especially in sectors most affected by the pandemic. The facility included a Base of the Pyramid Program offering additional support to the poorest and hardest-hit populations, starting at $400 million in 2021 and receiving an additional $200 million in 2022. This initiative helped preserve jobs by maintaining business operations during the pandemic.\n   - **Region:** Global  \n   - **Sector:** Private Sector / COVID-19 Response  \n   - **Donor/Fund:** IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility (supported by MDTF)  \n   - **Source:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 45\n\nThese examples illustrate how MDTF resources were mobilized to support private sector resilience and job retention during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020."
