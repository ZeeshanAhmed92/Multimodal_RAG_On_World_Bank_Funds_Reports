This support was crucial in preserving jobs and stabilizing economies in fragile and conflict-affected situations during the crisis.\n\n**Metadata:**  \n- Region: Global (including fragile and conflict-affected situations)  \n- Sector: Private Sector / Job Creation  \n- Donor/Fund: IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94  \n\n---\n\n### Example 2: Emergency Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Migrants and Refugees in Colombia\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn Colombia, the World Bank utilized grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees.
