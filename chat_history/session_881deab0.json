Title: IFC\u2019s Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility Supports Private Sector Jobs  \nSummary: Launched in 2020, IFC\u2019s Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility expanded to $8.6 billion to support private sector job creation during the pandemic. The initiative included a Base of the Pyramid Program, which provided additional support to the poorest and those hardest hit by COVID-19. The facility financed 103 projects with $7.4 billion, offering liquidity, working capital, and trade financing to keep companies operational, especially in the most affected industries. This support helped sustain jobs and stabilize businesses in fragile and conflict-affected situations.  \nMetadata:  \n- Region: Global (including fragile and conflict-affected situations)  \n- Sector: Private Sector Development  \n- Donor/Fund: IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94  \n\n2. Title: World Bank Emergency Cash Transfers Aid Vulnerable Migrants and Refugees  \nSummary: In 2020, the World Bank utilized grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees in Colombia. This intervention helped mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and eased tensions with host communities, indirectly supporting private sector job creation by stabilizing the social environment. Additionally, in Bangladesh, funding from the Human Capital Umbrella Program was used to add economic inclusion components to cash transfer programs, helping low-income wage earners improve their employment prospects post-pandemic. These efforts contributed to sustaining and creating jobs in fragile contexts during the crisis.  \nMetadata:  \n- Region: Colombia and Bangladesh  \n- Sector: Social Protection and Economic Inclusion  \n- Donor/Fund: State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF), Human Capital Umbrella Program  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94"
