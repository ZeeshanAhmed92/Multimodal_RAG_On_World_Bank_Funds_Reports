    "content": "**Overview of SPF Umbrella Trust Fund Grants**\n\nThe SPF Umbrella Trust Fund Grants are financial awards approved as of December 31, 2024, aimed at supporting various development objectives across different regions. These grants focus on addressing complex challenges related to state fragility, peacebuilding, forced displacement, social protection, climate action, gender issues, and mental health in conflict-affected and vulnerable communities globally.\n\nThe grants cover multiple regions including Africa (Great Lakes Region, Eastern and Southern Africa), the Middle East and North Africa, Europe and Central Asia, and global initiatives. Each grant targets specific development objectives such as enhancing social protection systems for forced displacement, supporting mental and family health services for internally displaced people, and informing global discussions on climate action's peace and social dividends.\n\nGrant amounts vary, with examples including $250,000 for social protection systems in the Great Lakes Region, $210,000 for gender and forced displacement in cities, and $400,000 for a global study on peace and social dividends of climate action. The grants support activities like rigorous assessments, recruitment and training of service providers, policy development, and dissemination of actionable frameworks to improve outcomes in fragile and conflict-affected settings.\n\n**Structured Metadata:**\n\n- **Region:** Global, Africa (Great Lakes, Eastern and Southern), Middle East and North Africa, Europe and Central Asia\n- **Sector:** Peacebuilding, Social Protection, Forced Displacement, Mental Health, Climate Action, Gender\n- **Donor/Fund:** SPF Umbrella Trust Fund\n- **Source Document and Page:** SPF Umbrella Trust Fund Grants 2024, Pages 2, 7, 11, 12, 15"
