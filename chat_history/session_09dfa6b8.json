This initiative provided $7.4 billion in financing for 103 projects aimed at maintaining liquidity, working capital, and trade financing for companies severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The facility especially targeted industries most affected by the crisis, helping to keep businesses operational and preserve jobs. Additionally, the Base of the Pyramid Program within this facility offered extra support to the poorest populations and those hardest hit by the pandemic, initially launching with $400 million in 2021 and receiving an additional $200 million in 2022. This program helped sustain employment opportunities in fragile and conflict-affected areas by stabilizing private sector operations during the crisis.\n\n- **Region:** Global, including fragile and conflict-affected situations  \n- **Sector:** Private Sector / COVID-19 Response  \n- **Donor/Fund:** IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- **Source Document and Page:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 44-45  \n\n---\n\n**Example 2: World Bank Emergency Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Migrants and Refugees in Colombia**\n\n**Summary of Outcome:**  \nIn Colombia, the World Bank utilized grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees during the COVID-19 pandemic. This intervention helped mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and eased social tensions between migrants and host communities. By supporting the economic inclusion of these vulnerable groups, the initiative helped maintain livelihoods and job opportunities in a fragile context. This approach contributed to stabilizing local economies and preserving private sector employment in communities affected by forced displacement and conflict.\n\n- **Region:** Colombia  \n- **Sector:** Social Protection / Private Sector Job Support  \n- **Donor/Fund:** State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF)  \n- **Source Document and Page:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 45"
