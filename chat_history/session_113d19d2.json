The facility increased to $8.6 billion, including a Base of the Pyramid Program that targeted the poorest and most vulnerable populations, initially funded at $400 million and later increased by $200 million in 2022. The initiative financed 103 projects providing liquidity, working capital, and trade financing to keep companies operational, particularly in sectors hardest hit by COVID-19. This support helped preserve jobs and stabilize businesses in fragile and conflict-affected areas. The facility\u2019s focus on maintaining business continuity directly contributed to job retention and creation during the crisis.\n\n- Region: Global, including Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations (FCS)  \n- Sector: Private Sector / COVID-19 Response  \n- Donor/Fund: IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94  \n\n---\n\n**Example 2: World Bank Emergency Cash Transfers to Support Vulnerable Workers**\n\nSummary:  \nIn 2020, the World Bank used grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and refugees in Colombia. This intervention aimed to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19 and ease social tensions with host communities. Additionally, in Bangladesh, funding from the Human Capital Umbrella Program was used to integrate economic inclusion components into major cash transfer programs. These efforts helped low-income wage earners gain better footholds in the labor market post-pandemic, supporting job retention and creation in fragile contexts. By targeting vulnerable populations, these programs helped sustain livelihoods and fostered economic stability in fragile settings.\n\n- Region: Colombia and Bangladesh  \n- Sector: Social Protection / Economic Inclusion  \n- Donor/Fund: State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF), Human Capital Umbrella Program  \n- Source Document and Page: WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, p. 94"
