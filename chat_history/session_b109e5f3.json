This initiative provided $7.4 billion to finance 103 projects offering liquidity, working capital, and trade financing. The facility especially targeted industries most affected by COVID-19, helping companies stay in business and preserve jobs. Additionally, the Base of the Pyramid Program was launched with $400 million to support the poorest and those hardest hit, receiving an extra $200 million in 2022. This comprehensive financial support helped sustain private sector employment in fragile and conflict-affected areas during a critical time.\n\n- **Region:** Global, including fragile and conflict-affected situations  \n- **Sector:** Private Sector / Job Creation  \n- **Donor/Fund:** IFC Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility  \n- **Source Document and Page:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 44  \n\n---\n\n**Example 2: World Bank Emergency Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Migrants and Refugees**\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn 2020, the World Bank used grant financing from the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) to provide emergency cash transfers to vulnerable migrants and Venezuelan refugees in Colombia. This intervention helped mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and eased tensions with host communities. By supporting vulnerable populations economically, the initiative indirectly contributed to preserving livelihoods and job opportunities in the private sector during the crisis. The program exemplifies how MDTF funding was used to protect jobs and promote social stability in fragile contexts.\n\n- **Region:** Colombia  \n- **Sector:** Social Protection / Private Sector Employment  \n- **Donor/Fund:** State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF)  \n- **Source Document and Page:** WBG Trust Fund Annual Report 2022, page 44"
